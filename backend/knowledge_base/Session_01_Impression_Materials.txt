PART A: IMPRESSION MATERIALS OVERVIEW
================================================================================

1. DEFINITION

Impression materials are used in the process of reproducing oral structures of a 
patient's mouth in a stone model so that we can:

- Either study them in greater detail when the patient is not present
- So that we can make a restoration directly on the model which will then be 
  placed into the patient's mouth

They create a NEGATIVE image of the patient's oral structures.

1.1. UNDERCUTS

In order for an impression to be withdrawn from the mouth it must be able to flex 
and distort; otherwise, it would be locked into areas from which it cannot be pulled 
out. These areas where the material becomes locked in are called "undercuts."

The undercut refers to the blackened area along the gingival margin of the tooth 
crown. If the material could not deform, then the impression would be locked in 
mechanically.

These undercut areas must COMPRESS during withdrawal of the impression, and then 
RETURN to their original positions in order to have an impression with dimensions 
that match that of the mouth (low distortion). Thus, we need for most impression 
materials to have a degree of flexibility.

1.2. TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPRESSION MANIPULATION

1.2.1. Proportioning of components: powder/liquid OR dispensing amounts of pastes
1.2.2. Mixing time and method: time to sufficiently mix components into homogeneous mass
1.2.3. Working time: time to place mixed material in tray and place in the mouth
1.2.4. Setting time: time the material needs to stay in mouth before removal
1.2.5. Method of removal from the mouth: quickly (snap) OR slowly
1.2.6. Method of disinfection: immersion OR spray only
1.2.7. Time to pour: immediately OR delayed
1.2.8. Time to remove from set stone model: soon OR can wait

1.3. WHAT WILL THE MODEL BE USED FOR?

Impression materials are selected based on intended use:

1.3.1. Study models
1.3.2. Create INDIRECT restorations (ones not made directly in the patient's mouth)
1.3.3. Crowns and bridges
1.3.4. Full and partial dentures
1.3.5. Framework for dental implants
1.3.6. Sport bite guards
1.3.7. Bleaching trays
1.3.8. Bite splints
1.3.9. Orthodontic cases

1.4. ACCURACY

Dental impression materials can be used for general cases that do not require high 
accuracy and/or highly accurate cases when restorative items will be made directly 
on the model.

1.4.1. Factors that can affect accuracy

1.4.1.1. Type of setting reaction
   1.4.1.1.1. Continued chemical reaction after removal from mouth (shrinkage)
   1.4.1.1.2. Change in temperature affects size of impression and thus the model
1.4.1.2. Volatile components/byproducts (evaporate and alter impression dimensions)
1.4.1.3. Continued setting after removal from mouth
1.4.1.4. Loss or gain of water when waiting to be poured or being disinfected

1.5. SETTING REACTIONS

1.5.1. IRREVERSIBLE: Set by chemical reaction in the mouth
1.5.2. REVERSIBLE: Set by cooling in the mouth

================================================================================

2. CLASSIFICATION

2.1. ELASTIC (FLEXIBLE)

Will spring back to shape after removal from the mouth

2.1.1. Hydrocolloids (natural components)
   2.1.1.1. Alginate
   2.1.1.2. Agar

2.1.2. Synthetic elastomeric materials (man-made components)
   2.1.2.1. Polysulfide
   2.1.2.2. Condensation silicone
   2.1.2.3. Addition silicone (PVS) (polyvinyl siloxane)
   2.1.2.4. Polyether

2.2. INELASTIC (RIGID)

Will not spring back to shape after removal from the mouth

2.2.1. Soften and set with temperature change (cooling) in the mouth
   2.2.1.1. Impression compound
   2.2.1.2. Wax

2.2.2. Set by a non-reversible chemical reaction
   2.2.2.1. ZOE (zinc oxide and eugenol)
   2.2.2.2. Gypsum type I (plaster)

================================================================================

3. ANALOG VS DIGITAL

Digital technology is a new, advanced technology for obtaining intraoral impression 
information. Digital impressions can be obtained directly within the patient's mouth 
(thus, no physical impression material is needed).

3.1. Using an intraoral digital scanner instead of a physical impression 
     (chairside scanning)

OR

3.2. The analog impression material or model can be scanned
   3.2.1. A bench top scanner can be used to scan an analog impression to obtain 
          a digital impression
   3.2.2. A bench top scanner can be used to scan a stone model to obtain a 
          digital impression

NOTE: This lecture focuses on physical (analog) impressions, not digital records 
of intraoral structures.

================================================================================

4. VISCOELASTICITY

Viscoelasticity is the property of a material to behave differently depending on 
how fast stress is applied.

4.1. VISCO: Relates to fluid-like nature (viscosity)
     - If stress is applied, the material does not rebound, but totally changes shape

4.2. ELASTICITY: Relates to solid-like behavior
     - If stress is applied, the material immediately rebounds back to its original 
       shape; it has ELASTIC qualities

ANALOGY: Think about how wet sand differs if you slowly wiggle your feet in it, 
and how differently it reacts if you hit it as hard and as fast as you can. When 
applying a slow rate of stress (such as wiggling your feet), the sand becomes fluid 
like and you slowly sink. However, on the same sand, if you walk briskly over it 
(using a high rate of stress application), the same sand acts like a solid.

4.3. HOW DO THESE PROPERTIES RELATE TO IMPRESSION MATERIALS?

4.3.1. When cured (set), impression materials exhibit viscoelastic properties.

EXAMPLE 1 - ALGINATE (Weak material):
Set alginate impression material is a non-rigid, material is weak, and can easily 
tear when removing it from the mouth. However, if you remove the impression from the 
mouth using a fast, SNAPPING MOTION (apply a high rate of stress), you will 
artificially make the material behave much more like an elastic solid, than a viscous 
fluid. Once it is removed, that material goes back to become weak and prone to 
tearing. Thus, the change in properties is only temporary but has allowed you to 
remove it from the mouth without tearing.

EXAMPLE 2 - SYNTHETIC ELASTOMERS (Strong material):
Now, consider an impression material that is already very strong and tear-resistant 
when it sets, not weak like alginate. If you were to remove it quickly, you would 
increase its tear strength, but you might just increase it to the point where you 
are capable of extracting teeth as well! So, remember the properties of a 
viscoelastic material. If you remove this more solid-like type of set material from 
the mouth using a SLOW, TEASING FORCE, you will temporarily change the properties 
of the material to be more fluid like, and the impression will flow a little bit 
while it distorts during removal from the mouth. After removal, the material will 
rebound (recover) its original position. After recovery, you can pour in the stone 
to obtain an accurate model.

The types of impression materials that behave like this are called the SYNTHETIC 
ELASTOMERS (addition silicone (PVS) and polyether).

================================================================================

5. COLLOID

A colloid is a solid, liquid, or gaseous substance made up of large molecules or 
masses of smaller molecules that remain in suspension in a surrounding continuous 
medium or different matter.

================================================================================

6. ALGINATE

Alginate is an irreversible hydrocolloid, extracted from certain brown seaweeds.

6.1. COMPOSITION

Alginate composition by percentage:
- 56% Sodium or Potassium Alginate: reacts and holds everything together
- 18% Diatomaceous Earth: unreactive filler, gives body/substance to mixed mass
- 14% Calcium Sulfate (CaSO4): provides calcium ions to react with alginate
- 10% Potassium Sulfate (K2SO4): counteracts inhibiting effect of hydrocolloid on stone
- 2% Trisodium Phosphate (Na3PO4): acts as inhibitor, provides working time

6.2. THIXOTROPIC

Thixotropic is the property of gels and other fluids to become less viscous and 
flow when subjected to steady shear forces through being shaken, stirred, squeezed, 
patted, or vibrated. When the shear force is decreased to zero, the viscosity 
increases to the original value.

6.3. GEL

A gel is a network of fibrils forming a weak, slightly elastic brush-heap structure 
of hydrocolloid.

6.4. GELATION

Gelation is the process of transforming a hydrocolloid from a sol to a gel.

Chemical reaction:
Na2n·Alginate + nCaSO4 (WATER) --> nNa2SO4 + Can(Alginate)2

Breaking this down:
[1] water + gypsum (Ca++) 
[2] Ca++ + Na3PO4 --> Ca3(PO4)2 (Trisodium Phosphate provides working time)
[3] Ca++ + alginate --> set material

6.5. SETTING REACTION

A specific amount of powder is mixed with a controlled volume of water, usually by 
hand in a rubber mixing bowl. The mixed material is removed from the bowl, placed 
into a perforated, stock impression tray, put into the mouth and seated to place and 
held securely until set. Once the material has hardened, it is removed with a 
SNAPPING MOTION from the anterior tray location.

6.6. SETTING TIME

The elapsed time from the start of mixing to the time at which the setting reaction 
essentially stops, as measured by reaching a desired hardness or consistency.

6.7. WORKING TIME

Elapsed time from the start of mixing to the time at which the consistency of a 
material is no longer suitable for its intended use or a rapid rise in viscosity 
occurs.

6.8. FACTORS THAT AFFECT SETTING REACTION

6.8.1. Type of material (rate of setting):
   - Type 1: fast setting
   - Type 2: normal setting

6.8.2. Temperature: affects solubility of calcium
   - WARM WATER SPEEDS UP: causes calcium from gypsum to go into solution faster
   - COLD WATER SLOWS DOWN: takes much longer for calcium from gypsum to go into 
     solution

6.9. SYNERESIS

Syneresis is the expression of fluid onto the surface of gel structures.

6.10. IMBIBITION

Imbibition is the displacement of one fluid by another immiscible fluid in a 
hydrocolloid. It refers to the uptake by agar or alginate when immersed in water 
onto the surface of gel structures.

IMPORTANT: Keep alginate mold at 100% humidity

6.11. CLINICAL TIPS AFTER THE MATERIAL HAS SET

6.11.1. WHEN / HOW TO REMOVE FROM THE MOUTH?

After the material first feels hard to fingernail indentation, add 2 minutes.
Remove from the mouth QUICKLY, (with a snapping motion) to lessen distortion 
(deformation) and increase tear strength (remember viscoelasticity).

6.11.2. WHEN POUR UP?

IMMEDIATELY

This is critical because of chances of water loss or gain (syneresis or imbibition). 
Remember, the major component in set material is water!

6.11.3. WHEN REMOVE IMPRESSION FROM SET STONE?

Remove just after the stone has cooled down.

If you leave the set alginate against the stone for a long time it will dry out the 
model, making it weak. This ruins the stone surface and may break teeth off when you 
separate them.

6.12. USES AND LIMITATIONS

Alginate hydrocolloid is a relatively inaccurate material:

LIMITATIONS:
- Tear strength is low, limits its use to supragingival areas
- Dimensional accuracy and surface detail reproducibility of alginate hydrocolloids 
  are very low, compared to the synthetic elastomers

APPROPRIATE USES:
- Study models, articulating models (opposing casts to a harder cast made from a 
  more accurate impression material and harder stone)
- Bleaching Trays
- Sports protective mouth guard

6.13. DISINFECTION

SPRAY with a diluted solution of sodium hypochlorite (0.5% in OPTIM® 1).
Leave in plastic bag for 1 minute.

IMPORTANT: Straight Clorox® liquid bleach is already 5-12% solution! So, if you 
use this, you must dilute 10-fold at least (read the bottle).

PROCEDURE:
1. OVER THE SINK: rinse impression of debris, and have an instructor check it
2. If OK, spray with OPTIM® 1
3. Wrap in moist paper towel and place in baggie for 1 minute on the tray (this 
   time will be both anti-viral and bactericidal)
4. Remove, rinse again liberally
5. Wrap in clean wet towel
6. Store in zip-lock bag until ready for pouring in stone

NEVER PUT THE IMPRESSION IN THE SINK!

Surface Disinfectant Contact Time (in seconds):
OPTIM® 1 (0.5% Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide)
- Mycobacteria TB: 60
- Non-enveloped Viruses (Adeno, Polio, Noro, Rota): 30
- Enveloped Viruses (RSV, HIV, HBV, HCV, Influenza A): 30
- Bacteria (MRSA, VRE, E. coli): 60

PART B: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION - SYNTHETIC ELASTOMERS
================================================================================

Reference Material: Chapter 8, pages 111-128
Instructor: Dr. Frederick Allen Rueggeberg

IMPORTANT NOTE: Study the following material on your own - still responsible for 
Quiz and Midterm Behavioral Objectives

================================================================================

10. SYNTHETIC ELASTOMERS

A. GENERAL USE OF SYNTHETIC ELASTOMERIC MATERIALS

All impression materials in this category will:
- Mix TWO paste materials
- Set by an irreversible chemical reaction

All are used to obtain high accuracy impressions for indirect restorations 
(ones made outside of the mouth in a dental laboratory and then cemented in place).

The synthetic elastomers differ from the other elastomeric materials (the alginate 
hydrocolloids) in that they contain only components that are man-made. They do not 
exist in nature, unlike the polysaccharides (sugars, agar) extracted from sea weed 
plants (kelp) found in the hydrocolloids.

ISSUE - VOIDS IN IMPRESSIONS AND MODELS:

- Voids from trapped air: Result of trapped air from impression not wetting oral 
  tissues; often seen with hydrophobic, synthetic elastomeric impression materials, 
  but still possible with hydrophilic impression materials

- Voids in stone model from stone not wetting the impression surface: Often seen 
  with hydrophobic, synthetic elastomeric impression materials, but still possible 
  with hydrophilic impression materials

B. ISSUES SEEN WITH HYDROPHOBIC IMPRESSION MATERIALS

a) Intraorally: Hard to get the unset material to cover tooth and gums
b) In lab: Difficult to pour stone without having bubbles on the surface of the model

SOLUTION: Spraying impression with "soap" (de-bubblizer) to allow wetting for 
pouring stone without formation of bubbles in the stone surface.

The synthetic elastomers are used when highly accurate dimensional reproduction of 
oral tissues is required, as well as high levels of surface details.

C. CAPTURING SUB-GINGIVAL PREPARATION MARGINS IN THE IMPRESSION

Often, the prepared marginal area of crowns and veneers is placed into the gingival 
sulcus (lower than the free gingival margin that appears visually), so that the 
junction of the restoration and the tooth will not be visible. 

Because of this preparation location, the impression material must:
- Be placed into this very thin sulcular area
- Set
- Be able to withstand the forces of withdrawal of the impression without tearing 
  or distorting

This aspect separates use of the alginate (which is weak and easily tears) from the 
synthetic elastomeric products, which are strong and tear-resistant. 

Therefore: Alginates are NOT used to capture sub-gingival margins, but the synthetic 
elastomers (addition silicone (polyvinyl siloxanes (PVS)) and polyethers) ARE used.

TECHNIQUE FOR OBTAINING SUB-GINGIVAL IMPRESSIONS:

1. Impression cord placed into the gingival sulcus to push the tissue away and make 
   space
2. Cord is then removed
3. Impression material is then quickly injected into the space created by the cord
4. Material flows into the gingival sulcus area to capture the margin

================================================================================

11. POLYVINYL SILOXANE SILICONE (PVS) - ADDITION SILICONES

Also known as:
- Polyvinyl siloxane (PVS)
- Vinyl Polysiloxane (VPS)

DEVELOPMENT: Developed to overcome the problems with releasing a by-product during 
the setting reaction of the first generation of products developed in this category 
(the condensation silicones).

The addition silicones are one of the most popular impression materials used today.

A. SETTING REACTION

Pre-polymer (Paste 1, base) + Pre-polymer (Paste 2, catalyst, plus platinum) 
--> cured material (+ H2 sometimes)

Pastes are delivered in separated barrels, put into a gun, forced through a mixing 
tube, and delivered to the tray.

B. PUTTY / WASH IMPRESSION TECHNIQUE FOR PVS MATERIALS

ADVANTAGES OF THIS TECHNIQUE:
- Eliminates need for a custom tray, which is expensive to make
- A custom tray is one fabricated in the dental office that is specific only for 
  that patient, not a stock impression tray

HOW THE TECHNIQUE IS PERFORMED:

1. Stock, disposable impression tray is selected (small, medium, large; narrow, 
   regular, wide arch)
2. Putty material is hand-mixed and placed into tray
3. Teeth covered with a sheet of plastic film (creates a spacer)
4. Stock tray with putty placed over covered teeth and allowed to set
5. Tray removed and set aside
6. Tooth prepared
7. A "wash" material of the PVS (very low viscosity - more water-like) is then 
   injected over prepared teeth
8. The cured putty impression is placed back in the mouth, over top of the wash 
   material just injected
9. The wash material sets and sticks to the set putty
10. After the wash material sets, the impression is removed, providing very accurate 
    impression with fine details

NOTE: In multi-color systems, the putty material is typically seen as one color 
(e.g., green) and the wash material is a different color (e.g., red).

PRECAUTION WITH SOME ADDITION REACTION SILICONE MATERIALS:

If you use gloves, be aware that sulfur in latex gloves inhibits the setting 
reaction of impression material. To overcome this problem:
- Over-glove a latex with plastic food-handler gloves, OR
- Use nitrile gloves

C. ADVANTAGES

- Shrinkage on curing: 0.16% (this is a VERY LOW number!)
- Best dimensional accuracy
- Best dimensional stability
- Can re-pour impression multiple times without worry of distortion
- Can ship set impression off to a dental lab for them to pour without worry of 
  dimensional changes occurring

D. DISADVANTAGES

- Naturally hydrophobic: Hydrophobic materials will have difficulty flowing over 
  moist mucosa and teeth when placing (leading to not capturing all the mouth 
  details) and also present a surface that is very difficult for pouring unset 
  stone into, without trapping air bubbles in the final product.

  HOWEVER... newer products add detergents to help make them more hydrophilic

- May need to wait until pouring the model because of the release of hydrogen gas 
  from the impression prior to pouring in stone

NOTE: Voids can be left in the stone model from trapped hydrogen gas produced 
during the setting of some PVS impression products.

E. USES

- Wherever high accuracy and high surface detail reproduction are needed
- Teeth prepared for crowns and bridges, inlays and onlays, ceramic veneers
- Edentulous ridge impressions for dentures

F. DISINFECTION

Immersion in 0.5% hydrogen peroxide (OPTIM1) for 1-5 minutes. Do NOT exceed 
manufacturer's recommended time.

WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT: The "soap" (surfactant) used to help pour up a stone model 
without including bubbles will dissolve out into the disinfecting solution, 
rendering the impression material more difficult to pour without getting bubbles.

================================================================================

12. POLYETHER IMPRESSION MATERIAL

An ether is a material that has a bond formation like this: 
carbon -- oxygen -- carbon (-C-O-C-)

A. SETTING REACTION

Pre-polymers (Paste 1) + Activator (Paste 2) --> set material

NOTE: The activator may be a skin sensitizer

Available in:
- Separate paste tubes to hand-mix, OR
- Large bags mixed in machine

B. CHARACTERISTICS

1. WORKING AND SETTING TIMES ARE SHORT

   Clinical implications:
   - Good for persons who gag
   - Not good for multiple preparations

2. SHRINKAGE ON CURING: 0.22%

3. TEAR STRENGTH: LOW

   Implications: Do not use where preparations are subgingival

4. NATURALLY HYDROPHILIC (WATER LOVING)

   Advantages:
   - Easy to get impressions in mouth (flows over oral tissues well)
   - Easy to pour without bubbles
   - Need to spray disinfect (not immerse); treat like a hydrocolloid

5. AFTER MATERIAL HAS SET, IT IS VERY STIFF

   Implications:
   - Difficult to remove from the mouth quickly; thus use a slow, teasing force
   - Do not want to use in full arch impressions
