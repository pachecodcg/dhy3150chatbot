KEY TERMS
Age hardening Process of hardening certain alloys by controlled heating and cooling, which usually is associated with a phase change.
Annealing The process of controlled heating and cooling that is
designed to produce desired properties in a metal. Typically, the
annealing process is intended to soften metals, increase their
ductility, stabilize shape, and increase machinability.
Antiflux A substance such as graphite that prevents the flow of
molten solder on areas coated by the substance.
Base metal A metal that readily oxidizes or corrodes. Important
base metals for dental alloys are nickel, cobalt, iron, titanium,
and chromium.
Cold welding The metal-joining process by metallic bonding that
does not rely on heating to achieve fusion but the pressure
applied to the interface between parts to be joined; no liquid
phase is produced within the interface joint.
CP Ti Commercially pure titanium, which consists of 99 wt% or
higher-purity titanium, with oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and
hydrogen dissolved interstitially.
Dislocation An imperfection in the crystalline arrangement of atoms consisting of an extra partial plane of atoms (edge dislocation), a spiral distortion of normally parallel atom planes (screw
dislocation), or a combination of the two types.
Flux Compound applied to metal surfaces that dissolves or prevents
the formation of oxides and other undesirable substances that
may reduce the quality or strength of a soldered or brazed area.
Grain growth The increase in the mean crystal size of a polycrystalline metal produced by a heat-treatment process.
Grain refinement The process of reducing the crystal (grain) size
in a solid metal through the action of specific alloying elements
or compounds; the process increases the yield strength of metals.
Lost wax technique Process in which a wax pattern, prepared in
the shape of missing tooth structure, is embedded in a casting
investment and burned out to produce a mold cavity into which
molten metal is cast.
Noble metal Gold and platinum group metals (platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium), which

are highly resistant to oxidation and dissolution in inorganic
acids.
Precipitation hardening The process of strengthening and
hardening a metal by precipitating a phase or constituent from
a saturated solid solution.
Recovery A stage of heat treatment that results in the partial
restoration of properties of a work-hardened metal without a
change in the grain structure.
Recrystallization The process of forming new stress-free crystals
in a work-hardened metal through a controlled heat-treatment
process.
Soldering Process of building up a localized area of a metal prosthesis with a molten filler metal or joining two or more metal components by heating them to a temperature below their solidus temperature and filling the gap between them using a molten metal
with a lower liquidus temperature. If the melting temperature of
the solder is greater than 450 °C, the process is called brazing.
Springback The amount of elastic strain that a metal can recover
when loaded to and unloaded from its yield strength; an important property of orthodontic wires.
Strain hardening The increase in strength and hardness and
decrease in ductility of a metal that is caused by permanent
deformation below its recrystallization temperature; also called
work hardening or cold working.
Superelasticity The ability of certain nickel-titanium alloys to
undergo extensive elastic deformation resulting from a stressassisted phase transformation, with the reverse transformation
occurring on unloading; sometimes called pseudoelasticity.
Welding Process of fusing two or more metal parts through the
application of heat, pressure, or both, with and without a filler
metal, to produce a localized union across an interface between
the workpieces.
Working range The maximum amount of elastic strain that an
orthodontic wire can sustain before it permanently deforms.
Wrought alloy A metal that has been permanently deformed to
alter the shape of the structure and certain mechanical properties, such as strength, hardness, and ductility.

Indirect Restorative Materials

In his 1907 U.S. Patent 865823, Taggart described a method of
making gold inlays using the lost wax technique. The lost wax
method of making metal objects involves pouring a molten metal
into a mold that has been created with a wax pattern (Chapter 14,
Wax Pattern and Sprue Design). The process led to making custom
precision casts for the restoration of missing tooth structure, such
as onlays, crowns, multiple-unit fixed dental prostheses (FDPs),
and frameworks for removable partial dentures (RPDs). Since the
early 1980s, the numbers of dental alloys, along with new alloy
systems, have increased dramatically as a result of the market-price
increase of noble metals, the performance of the same function
at a lower cost, the need for increasingly specialized physical and
mechanical properties, and the awareness of the importance of
biological properties.
Objects of any design, intricate or simple, can be produced by
using the lost wax technique as long as a wax pattern can be made
and invested, and alloys can be melted, or by using alternative
processing techniques such as computer-aided design/computeraided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) milling and three-dimensional
(3-D) printing. On the other hand, many ancillary dental materials and instruments are fabricated from initially cast alloys that
have been subsequently rolled to form sheets or rods, drawn into
wire or tubing, or forged into a finished shape. Rolling, drawing,
and forging are major processes of permanently deforming metals.
Whenever a cast pure metal or alloy is permanently deformed to
an intended shape in any manner, it is considered a wrought alloy.
This permanent deformation alters the microstructure, and the alloy
exhibits properties that are different from those it had in the as-cast
state. The most significant change is the increase of yield strength
with a reduction in ductility. The applications of wrought alloys in
dentistry include orthodontic wires, clasps for RPDs, root canal files
and reamers, preformed crowns in pediatric dentistry, and surgical
instruments. Most metal-based restorations and prostheses are cast
and not wrought.
In the construction of dental appliances, there is often a need to
join metal parts, cast or wrought, together using high heat. When
wrought alloys are involved in such joining, the strength and fracture resistance of the wrought alloy will be compromised if the
metal is exposed to the temperature range at which the wrought
structure is diminished or lost. Such weakening can occur during
the metal-joining process for stainless-steel orthodontic appliances.
The ability to work with dental alloys and associated wrought
alloys is dependent on a knowledge of these materials. The goal
of this chapter is for the reader to become familiar with various types of casting alloys and associated wrought alloys. We
will discuss the desirable properties and the relevant mechanical
properties of dental alloys first. For casting alloys, the focus is
the alloy classification and clinical applications of the alloys. For
wrought alloys, the focus is the process of permanent deformation and its effect on the properties for their specific applications
in dentistry. Several types of wrought alloys used in dentistry are
described. The description of joining metals is like that for bonding presented in Chapter 6; the emphasis is on the principles and
procedures of the process.
As previously done in Chapter 2, Metals, the terms metal and
alloy are frequently used interchangeably.

Desirable Properties of Dental Alloys
Depending on the primary purpose of the prosthesis, the choice
of casting alloy is made by the dentist in collaboration with a
qualified dental laboratory technician or technologist. From the

standpoint of patient safety and the risk of medico-legal issues, it
is highly important to understand the following clinically important requirements and properties of dental casting alloys:
1. Biocompatibility—The alloy must tolerate oral fluids and not
release any harmful products into the oral environment that
might cause a toxic or allergic reaction. Biocompatibility will
be covered in Chapter 17.
2. Tarnish and Corrosion Resistance—Corrosion is the physical deterioration of a material in the oral environment, and
tarnish is a thin film that is adherent to the metal surface
(Chapter 3, Tarnish and Corrosion). Both phenomena affect
the durability and appearance of the prostheses.
3. Thermal Properties—The melting range of the casting alloys
must be low enough to form smooth surfaces with the mold
wall of the casting investment (Chapter 14, Investment Materials). For metal-ceramic prostheses, the alloys must have closely
matching thermal expansion coefficients to be compatible with
the given porcelains, and they must tolerate high processing
temperatures without deforming via a creep process.
4. Strength Requirements—The alloy must have sufficient strength
for the intended application. For example, alloys for bridgework
require higher strength than alloys for single crowns.
5. Fabrication—The molten alloy should flow freely into the
investment mold, without any appreciable interaction with the
investment material, and wet the mold to form a surface free of
porosity. It should be possible to cut, grind, finish, and polish
the alloy to obtain a prosthesis with a satisfactory surface finish.
6. Porcelain Bonding—The alloy must be able to form a thin
adherent oxide that enables chemical bonding to ceramic
veneering materials.
7. Economic Considerations—The cost of metals used for single-unit prostheses or as frameworks for FDPs or RPDs is a
function of the metal density, fluctuations in metal prices,
and the cost per unit mass.

Functional Mechanical Properties of Alloys
Mechanical properties are the measured responses of materials in
the form of stress and strain under an applied force or distribution of forces. The relevant functional characteristics of casting
and wrought alloys are described next.

CRITICAL QUESTIONS
What are two clinical disadvantages of cast metals that have lower elastic
moduli? Why does a long-span bridge require alloys of high elastic modulus?

Elastic Modulus
One characteristic of a material with a high elastic modulus is its
rigidity or stiffness. For a dental prosthesis, rigidity is equivalent to
the resistance to flexure (bending). When a long-span FDP flexes
during occluding of the pontic, the mesiodistal bending moment
exerted on the abutment teeth can act as a dislodging force, lifting the mesial and distal aspects of the prosthesis. Furthermore,
a flexing bridge can induce lateral forces on the abutment teeth,
resulting in the loosening of these teeth. For a metal-ceramic
prosthesis, the overlying brittle porcelain will fail catastrophically
when the metal substructure flexes beyond the flexural limit of
the ceramic. The elastic modulus is also important for the major
connectors of an RPD, which must have enough rigidity to prevent flexure during the placement and function of the prosthesis.

CHAPTER 9

Resistance to flexure also allows the clasps of an RPD to fit into
areas of minimal undercuts and still provide adequate retention.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Why is it that a cast prosthesis that is subjected to tensile stress above the
alloy yield strength will not necessarily fracture?

Yield Strength (Proof Stress)
Recall the discussion in Chapter 4, Stress-Strain Properties that
yield strength, elastic limit, and proportional limit, by definition,
are different properties, but all three terms have been used to reflect
the capacity of a cast prosthesis to withstand mechanical stresses
without permanent deformation. Ideally, dental alloys should have
a high yield strength so that a large amount of stress must be applied
before a permanent change in dimensions occurs. For an orthodontic appliance, it relates to the maximum force the wire can deliver.
Generally, alloys with tensile yield strengths above 300 MPa function satisfactorily in the mouth.

CRITICAL QUESTION
How does the alloy ductility increase the fracture resistance of a margin of a
cast metal crown or a clasp arm on an RPD?

Ductility (Percent Elongation)
Ductility represents the amount of permanent deformation under
tensile stress that an alloy can undergo before it fractures. If the
force applied is in a compressive mode, the property is called
malleability. A reasonable amount of ductility and malleability is
essential if a prosthesis requires adjustment to be functional, such
as the bending of RPD clasps and the burnishing of crown margins. As discussed earlier, one needs to apply stress greater than
the yield strength of the material to cause permanent deformation
on a metal surface. Therefore, high ductility allows one to achieve
more permanent deformation without fracture but does not indicate if burnishing or adjusting the prosthesis would be easier or
more difficult in terms of the stress required.

the prosthesis. Eventually, a crack propagates to a critical size,
and sudden fracture occurs. Common engineering expressions of
fatigue fracture resistance are fatigue strength and endurance limit
(Figure 4.15). Fatigue strength (SNf) is defined as the stress at which
failure occurs after a specific number of fatigue cycles. Endurance
limit is the maximum stress that can be maintained without failure
over an infinite number of cycles. Some alloys do not have a welldefined endurance limit.

Classification of Dental Casting Alloys
In 1932, the dental materials group at the National Bureau of Standards (now National Institute of Standards and Technology) classified dental gold alloys being used then by Vickers hardness number
(VHN): type I (soft, VHN 50 to 90), type II (medium, VHN 90
to 120), type III (hard, VHN 120 to 150), and type IV (extra hard,
VHN 150 and above). Since then, the number of alloy compositions
and applications has increased vastly. They are now classified according to composition, intended usage, or mechanical properties.

Alloy Classification by Noble Metal Content
In 1984, the American Dental Association (ADA) proposed a simple
classification for dental casting alloys based on the content of noble
metals. Three categories were described: high noble (HN), noble
(N), and predominantly base metal (PB). Subsequently, a fourth
group of titanium and titanium alloys was added because of the
unique characteristics of titanium. This classification is presented in
Table 9-1. Noble metals comprise a group of seven metals that are
resistant to corrosion and tarnish in the mouth. In order of increasing melting temperature, they include gold, palladium, platinum,
rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium. These noble metals and
silver are sometimes called precious metals, referring to their high economic value, but the term precious is not synonymous with noble.
Silver is reactive in the oral cavity and is not a noble metal.
Based on this classification, the IdentAlloy program was
established by manufacturers to provide documentation of certified alloys. Under this program, each alloy has a certificate
(Figure 9-1) that lists its manufacturer, alloy name, composition,
and ADA classification. Some insurance companies use it as well
to determine the cost of crown and bridge treatment. Keep in
mind that this system certifies only the composition of alloys.

Why is a harder metal more resistant to wear than a softer metal?

Hardness
Clinically, hardness reflects the resistance of the restoration to
scratching and abrasion by the opposing tooth or restoration
and the ability to maintain the smoothness of the prosthesis in
the oral environment. However, a harder restoration surface can
cause excessive wear of softer opposing dentition or restorations.
In addition, harder surfaces are more difficult to cut, grind, finish,
and polish because higher stress is required for each procedure.

Fatigue Resistance
Fatigue failure can occur when a material is subjected to repeated
loading and unloading below its elastic limit. Most fractures of
prostheses and restorations develop progressively over many stress
cycles of loading and unloading. When the load is above a certain threshold, crack propagation is initiated from flaws within

Alloy Classification by Mechanical Properties
The historic ADA Specification No. 5, which originally had composition ranges for the component elements in the four types of gold
casting alloys, evolved to stipulating mechanical property requirements for yield strength, percentage elongation, and Vickers hardness. The relevant current standard is International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) 22674:2016, which classifies metallic
materials for fixed and removable restorations and appliances into
six types according to yield strength and elongation, regardless of
noble metal contents (Table 9-2).

Alloys may be classified based on the principal or most abundant element (e.g., a palladium-based alloy), or they may be
named based on the two or three most important elements (e.g.,
Pd-Ag, Co-Cr, or Ni-Cr-Be alloys). The components are listed
in decreasing order of weight percent. An exception to this rule
is the identification of elements that substantially affect the
properties of the alloy. For example, Ni-Cr-Mo-Be alloys are
often designated as Ni-Cr-Be alloys because of the contributions
of beryllium to the control of castability and surface oxidation
at high temperatures and the relative health-hazard potential
of beryllium compared with other metals. Castability refers to
the ease of making quality castings. Excellent websites to view
the wide range of dental alloy compositions include Argen at

Alloy Classification by Principal Elements

There are three categories of dental casting alloys designated by
application: all-metal fixed prostheses, metal-ceramic prostheses,
and RPDs. Each type of alloy classified by noble metal content
(Table 9-1) is available in all three categories. One may use highnoble and noble alloys intended for metal-ceramic prostheses to
fabricate all-metal prostheses. However, alloys for all-metal restorations, which can deform or melt during porcelain-firing, should
not be used to make metal-ceramic restorations.
Base-metal and titanium alloys, on the other hand, are often
marketed for both all-metal and metal-ceramic prostheses because
of their oxide formation at room temperature. In this chapter,
dental alloys are discussed by their applications.

gold-based RPD is now rare). The alloys for bridge and RPD
framework constructions must be sufficiently rigid to resist
flexure, possess high yield strength to prevent permanent distortion, and be ductile enough for adjustment if the clasp of a
framework has been distorted or needs adjustment.
Various elements have been incorporated into gold alloys to
produce alloys with suitable properties. For example, platinum
and palladium increase the hardness and elastic modulus of gold
and raise the melting temperature of the alloy. A higher melting
temperature is beneficial when components are to be joined by
soldering. Copper in a sufficient quantity relative to the gold content renders the alloy heat-treatable (Chapter 2, Gold-Copper System) but can alter the color of the alloy. Silver forms solid solutions
with gold and palladium and is effective in neutralizing the reddish color of copper in gold-copper alloys. Palladium has a good
range of solubility with gold, silver, and copper, resulting in good
mechanical properties and improvement of tarnish and corrosion

High-Noble and Noble Alloys
The compositions of selected high-noble and noble alloys are
given in Table 9-3. Their physical and mechanical properties
are shown in Table 9-4. Gold and palladium are the two major
elements that make up the nobility of noble and high-noble alloys;
these alloys are discussed in two categories: Au-based alloys and
Pd-based alloys.

Gold-Based Alloys
Referring to Table 9-2, type 1 alloys are designed for inlays
that are not subjected to substantial mastication forces. Type 2
alloys having greater mechanical properties than type 1 are used
for one-surface inlays. Type 3 alloys are used for constructing
crowns, bridge abutments, and inlays, which are subjected to
great stress during mastication. Type 4 alloys are used in highstress areas such as bridges and RPD frameworks (although the

resistance. Zinc acts as an oxygen scavenger during the melting

CRITICAL QUESTIONS
What effects can the cooling rate of a heat-treated type 3 gold-copper alloy
have on its hardness and ductility?
What happens within gold-copper alloys that are subjected to a prescribed
heating–cooling cycle?

The underlying principles for heat treatment of these alloys have
been discussed in Chapter 2, Gold-Copper System. Briefly, the
casting is placed in a furnace at 700 °C for 10 minutes, and then
quenched in water to retain a disordered solid-solution phase with
reduced yield strength and hardness but increased ductility. The
process is called a solution heat treatment. The same casting is placed
in a furnace with the temperature set between 200 and 450 °C for
15 to 30 minutes before quenching in water. The treatment produces
regions of ordered solid-solution phase with increased yield strength
and hardness but a reduction of elongation (Table 9-4). The process
is called age hardening.
The softening heat treatment is indicated for prostheses that are
ground or reshaped (permanent deformation) to a different form,
either in or out of the mouth, to restore their ductility. Because the
proportional limit is increased during age hardening, a considerable increase in the modulus of resilience can be expected. The
hardening heat treatment is indicated for metallic RPDs, saddles,
FDPs, and other similar structures where rigidity of the prosthesis
is needed. For small structures, such as inlays, a hardening treatment is not usually required.

CRITICAL QUESTION
What characteristics of palladium make it a natural choice of element to
replace gold for dental alloys?

Silver-Palladium Alloys
Silver-palladium alloys are often white and predominantly silver in composition and must contain at least 25% palladium to
provide tarnish and corrosion resistance of the alloy. They may
also contain copper and a small amount of gold to increase the
ductility and improve the castability of the alloy for dental applications. Ag-Pd alloys can produce acceptable castings when close
attention is paid to precise control of the casting and mold temperatures. Casting temperatures are in the range of those for yellow gold alloys. The copper-free Ag-Pd alloys may have physical
properties similar to those of a type 3 gold alloy. With 15% or
more copper, the alloy may have properties more like those of a
type 4 gold alloy.
Indium and palladium at a 1:1 atomic ratio form a gold-color
intermetallic compound. When the content of indium in a Pd-Ag
alloy is 18% to 30% by weight, the alloy achieves a gold-like color.
The colored phase of the Pd-In binary alloy system is hard and
brittle and is not a strengthener. Iridium or ruthenium is added
in small quantities to high-noble and noble alloy compositions
for grain refinement because smaller grains improve the yield
strength (Chapter 2, Grain Refinement and Grain Size).

CRITICAL QUESTION
What is the role of chromium in predominantly base-metal alloys? How does
beryllium improve the properties of nickel-based alloys?

Predominantly Base-Metal Alloys
Currently, there are two main groups of base-metal dental alloys:
nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) and cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr). The
Ni-Cr alloys can be further divided into those with and without
beryllium, which improves castability and promotes the formation of a stable metal oxide for porcelain bonding. The majority of
Ni-Cr alloys are used for small castings such as crowns and FDPs,
and Co-Cr alloys are primarily used for casting RPDs for which a
high elastic modulus and yield strength are needed. Table 9-5 lists
the compositions and properties of selected base-metal alloys for
all-metal and metal-ceramic applications.
Chromium, a critical element of base-metal alloys, oxidizes
rapidly on the surface of the alloy to form a thin layer of chromium oxide, which prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the
underlying metal and the corrosion process. Chromium in the
bulk alloy also provides strengthening by solid-solution hardening. Molybdenum increases corrosion resistance and strength and
decreases the thermal expansion coefficient of base-metal alloys.
Higher thermal expansion is beneficial for porcelain bonding and
minimizes the risk of porcelain cracking or fracture. Some minor
elements are incorporated to improve manipulation and mechanical properties. For example, beryllium lowers the fusion temperature of the alloys, which improves castability, and refines grain
size, which increases strength. Manganese and silicon also improve
the castability of the alloys. Carbon forms carbides with other elements in the alloy, increasing the hardness and yield strength with
a reduction in ductility. The aluminum in Ni-Cr alloys forms a
nickel-aluminum compound, Ni3Al, which increases both the
yield strength and the tensile strength. Nitrogen, which is incorporated in the alloy during casting in ambient air, also improves
the overall qualities of the casting.
The manipulation and mechanical properties of base-metal
alloys are described in more detail in the following section on
alloys for metal-ceramic prostheses and in the subsequent section
on RPDs because base metals are used to a lesser extent for allmetal prostheses.

Titanium and Titanium Alloys
Titanium has a high melting point (1668 °C) and a high rate
of oxidation above 900 °C. It requires a special casting machine
with high-temperature melting capability in a nonoxidizing
chamber. For example, an argon arc with a nonconsumable
tungsten electrode or high-frequency induction is used for melting titanium alloys in crucibles made of copper, magnesia, or
carbon and in an argon or helium atmosphere. A casting investment consisting of oxides, such as MgO, ZrO2, or Y2O3, which
are more stable than titanium oxide, is used to ensure acceptable
castability. Centrifugal force, casting-pressure difference, and gas
pressure have been used to force the molten-metal flow into the
mold. Titanium can react with the investment material during
casting and forms a very hard surface layer called α-case, with a
thickness up to 150 μm. The VHN of cast commercially pure
titanium increases from a bulk value of nearly 200 to approximately 650 at a depth of 25 μm below the surface. Special instruments are required in the dental laboratory for finishing and
adjusting titanium castings.
Titanium derives its corrosion protection from a thin passivating oxide film (about 10 nm thick), which forms spontaneously
with the surrounding oxygen. Titanium is considered the most
biocompatible metal used for dental restorations and prostheses.

Elastic modulus is approximately 110 GPa for each type.

Commercially Pure Titanium
According to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard F67, there are four unalloyed grades of
commercially pure titanium (CP Ti) based on the concentration of impurities (Table 9-6). The elastic modulus of CP Ti
is comparable to that of tooth enamel and noble alloys, but it
is lower than that of other base-metal alloys (Table 9-5). CP Ti is
often selected for its excellent corrosion resistance, especially in
applications for which high strength is not required. The major
strengthening element is oxygen. Increasing the oxygen content
of CP Ti increases not only the flexural strength but also the
fatigue strength.

CRITICAL QUESTIONS
Why is a Ti-Al-V alloy with high strength not always preferred to the
commercially pure titanium metal for dental prostheses? How do alloying
elements affect the properties of titanium dental alloys?

Titanium Alloys
CP Ti undergoes an allotropic (polymorphic) transformation from
a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (α phase) at 882 °C to a
more ductile body-centered crystal structure (β phase). By incorporating a combination of α- and β-phase stabilizers, four possible types of titanium alloys can be produced: α, near-α, α-β, and

β. Alpha-phase stabilizers, such as aluminum, carbon, nitrogen,
and gallium, raise the temperature for transforming α to β phase
on heating. Beta-phase stabilizers, such as molybdenum, cobalt,
nickel, niobium, copper, palladium, tantalum, and vanadium,
lower the temperature for transforming β to α phase on cooling.
Alpha alloys will form no β phase on cooling. Near-alpha alloys will
form a limited amount of β phase on cooling. Alpha-beta alloys are
metastable, which makes them heat-treatable and will contain both
phases at room temperature. Thermal treatment dictates the relative amount of α and β phases and mechanical properties. Beta
alloys contain sufficient beta stabilizers to retain the β phase on
cooling; they can be solution-treated and aged to improve strength.
The most widely used titanium alloy in dentistry and for general engineering applications is Ti-6Al-4V, which is an α-β alloy.
Although this alloy has greater strength than CP Ti, it is not as
attractive for dentistry and biomedical applications because of some
concerns about health hazards from the slow release of aluminum
and vanadium. Vanadium in high doses is highly toxic, and aluminum has been reported to cause potential neurological disorders.
Niobium has not been associated with any known toxic or adverse
reactions in the body and belongs to the same group as vanadium
in the periodic table. Replacing vanadium in Ti-6Al-4V with the
same atomic percentage of niobium yields Ti-6Al-7Nb. Both alloys
are considered to be acceptable for biomedical applications. The
mechanical properties of the two alloys are similar (Table 9-7), and
their corrosion resistance is similar to that of CP Ti. Their elastic
moduli are similar to those of type 4 alloys, and yield strengths
range from those of type 2 to type 5 metallic materials, as described
in ISO 22674 (Table 9-2).

CRITICAL QUESTION
Why does the manipulation of titanium alloys differ so much from that for
Co-Cr and Ni-Cr alloys?

Manipulation of Titanium Alloys
The surface of titanium castings after divestment must be ground
and polished to remove surface porosity and the α case for optimal functionality of the final prosthesis. The machinability of titanium and its alloys is generally considered poor because of several
inherent properties of titanium, such as high chemical reactivity,
relatively low thermal conductivity, high strength at high temperature, and low modulus of elasticity.
To eliminate the effect of oxygen during the fabrication of titanium prostheses, CAD-CAM has been used to produce titaniumbased fixed prosthesis frameworks.

Alloys for Metal-Ceramic Prostheses
The chief objections to the use of dental porcelain as a restorative material are its low tensile strength and shear strength
(Chapter 10, Mechanical Properties). A method of minimizing this disadvantage is to bond the porcelain directly to a cast
alloy substructure made to fit the prepared tooth. The process
requires building on the metal substrate a tooth form with
ceramic powder held together by a binder and subjecting the
entire assembly to a heating process called sintering. Sintering
densifies the packed ceramic particles to a solid firmly bonded
to the metal substrate. This system is referred to as the porcelainfused-to-metal (PFM) design. The preferred descriptive term for
this composite system is metal-ceramic, and the metal is called
metal-ceramic alloy. In this section, the requirements of metals,
some representative alloy systems, and issues associated with
these alloys are discussed.

Requirements of Alloys for Metal-Ceramic
Applications
The alloys discussed in this section share at least three common
features: (1) the potential to bond to dental porcelain, (2) solidus
temperature sufficiently high to resist softening during sintering,
and (3) coefficients of thermal contraction compatible with those
of dental porcelain.

Porcelain Bonding to Metals
Porcelain bonding to metal substrate requires adherent oxides
on the surface. The addition of a small quantity of an appropriate base metal to noble and high-noble alloys promotes oxide
formation on the surface. For base-metal alloys, some oxides
may be poorly adherent to the metal substructure, which can
result in porcelain delaminating from the metal substrate. However, the bond strengths for porcelain bonded to base-metal
alloys as determined in vitro have not generally been shown
to be superior or inferior to those of noble-metal alloys. Furthermore, clinical studies have not demonstrated a significant
difference in the failure incidence between metal-ceramic restorations made from base-metal alloys and those fabricated from
high-noble or noble-metal alloys. To produce the optimal metal
oxide characteristics, the manufacturer’s instructions must be
followed precisely.
Solidus Temperature
When an alloy is heated close to its solidus temperature, it
becomes susceptible to deformation under its own mass, which
is known as creep. The degree of creep increases with the size of
the prosthesis and the number of firings required for the porcelain. In the older literature, this creep process is referred to as the
sag of the ceramic alloy (Figure 9-2). All metal-ceramic alloys
should have a solidus temperature that is substantially higher
than the sintering temperature of the porcelain to minimize
creep deformation.

CRITICAL QUESTIONS
How can differences in thermal contraction between a metal and its
veneering ceramic affect the resistance to cracking or fracture of the veneer?
Why must a metal for metal-ceramic prostheses have its thermal contraction
coefficient slightly higher than that of its veneering ceramic?

Thermal Compatibility of Metal-Ceramic Systems
The thermal expansion and contraction values of base-metal alloys
are generally similar to those of noble-metal alloys. When a metalceramic prosthesis is cooled from the porcelain sintering temperature,
the metal and its veneering ceramic contract at different rates. Meanwhile, the chemical bond between the metal and the porcelain prevents
the two components from separating; this condition forces the two
components to adjust their respective dimensions during the cooling
cycle. Thus the component that contracts more will be stretched by
the adjacent component, which contracts less; together, the material
that contracts less will be compressed by the other component. Such
changes in dimension result in stresses that act on each of the two
components. The instantaneous stress at a given temperature during
the cooling cycle is termed transient stress, and the stress distribution,
which exists at room temperature, is called the residual stress. When
the prosthesis is cooled, the tensile stress that develops in the porcelain
is of concern. If the transient tensile stresses that develop within porcelain during cooling are insufficient to cause immediate cracking of
the porcelain or delayed cracking after cooling to room temperature,
the combination of a metal-porcelain system is considered thermally
compatible. In fact, a slight thermal contraction mismatch, with a
coefficient of thermal contraction of about 0.5 × 10–6/°C higher for
the metal, is preferred because the mismatch induces residual compressive stress in the porcelain along the bonded interface, which is
protective in nature. This mechanism will be discussed in Chapter 10,
Coefficient of Thermal Expansion Mismatch.

Gold-Platinum-Palladium Alloys
Gold-platinum-palladium alloys produced the first successful
metal-ceramic restorations. Platinum raises the melting temperature. Rhenium (Re) is a grain refiner that increases hardness. Iron
forms an oxide on the surface for porcelain bonding and increases
the proportional limit and strength of the alloy by an FePt3 precipitate. These alloys have adequate elastic modulus, strength,
hardness, and elongation but are low in sag resistance. They are
mostly used for making crowns and three-unit FDPs. Their use
has decreased over time because more economical alloys have been
developed with substantially better mechanical properties.
Gold-Palladium-Silver Alloys
Gold-palladium-silver alloys are economical alternatives to the
Au-Pt-Pd or Au-Pd-Pt alloys. Their excellent tarnish and corrosion resistance and relative freedom from technique sensitivity
have contributed to their long-term success. The higher palladium concentration above those of the Au-Pt-Pd alloys raises the
melting ranges and improves resistance to creep deformation at
elevated temperatures.
Gold-Palladium Alloys
These silver-free alloys are white in color and have a lower thermal contraction coefficient than that of either the Au-Pd-Ag or
Pd-Ag alloys. When used with compatible low-expansion or lowcontraction porcelains, Au-Pd alloys are considered nearly ideal
compared with other noble-metal alloys because these alloys contain no silver, and their surface oxide is virtually indiscernible.
Thus the esthetic quality of metal-ceramic prostheses made with
Au-Pd alloys is comparable to that obtained with Au-Pt-Pd alloys.
The sag resistance of these alloys is somewhat better than that of
Au-Pt-Pd alloys.
Palladium-Gold Alloys
The physical properties of palladium-gold alloys are generally
similar to those of the Au-Pd alloys, and potential thermal contraction concerns for these alloys seem to have been resolved by
changes in the porcelain composition. Few data are available on
their laboratory and clinical performance.
Palladium-Gold-Silver Alloys
Palladium-gold-silver alloys are similar to the Au-Pd-Ag alloys in
their potential for porcelain discoloration. They have a range of
thermal contraction coefficients, which increase with an increase
in silver content.
Palladium-Silver Alloys
This alloy type was the first gold-free noble alloy for metal-ceramic
restorations. The replacement of gold by palladium raises the melting range but lowers the thermal expansion coefficient of the alloy.
Silver, on the other hand, lowers the melting range but increases

the thermal expansion coefficient. A proper balance of the two elements maintains a reasonably low casting temperature and a compatible thermal expansion coefficient. The thermal compatibility
of these alloys is generally good except with certain low-expansion
porcelains. The addition of tin and indium promotes oxide formation for porcelain bonding and yields precipitates for improving
mechanical properties.

Adherence to porcelain is considered acceptable for most of
the Pd-Ag alloys. However, Mackert et al. reported that one of
these alloy products formed an internal oxide rather than the preferred external oxide. Instead, Pd-Ag nodules developed on the
surface (Figure 9-3) facilitate the retention of porcelain mechanically. This condition has not apparently produced clinical bond
failures to warrant concern, and other Pd-Ag ceramic alloys have

not been studied to determine whether they have similar oxidation behavior.
Because of their high silver content compared with that of
gold-based alloys, the potential silver discoloration effect is most
severe for these alloys. One should proceed with caution when
light shades (higher values) of ceramic are desired.

Palladium-Copper-Gallium Alloys
Compositional differences for the Pd-Cu-Ga alloys result in a
wide range of mechanical properties: yield strengths ranging from
520 MPa to over 1200 MPa, percent elongation ranging from 7%
to 30%, and VHN ranging from approximately 265 to over 400.
Careful composition control by manufacturers has resulted in
Pd-Cu-Ga alloys with VHNs of substantially less than 300.
The dark brown or black oxide formed during oxidation and subsequent porcelain sintering cycles makes it difficult for a technician to
mask the color. Sometimes a thicker opaque porcelain layer is required
to avoid excessive darkness (i.e., low value) with certain porcelains. An
increase in oxide-layer thickness occurs during the initial oxidation
step for these alloys. To reduce the discoloration effect, the surface can
be sandblasted prior to the application of opaque porcelain.
Palladium-Gallium Alloys
The Pd-Ga alloys also have relatively dark oxides, which are somewhat lighter than those on the Pd-Cu-Ga alloys. Pd-Ga alloys generally tend to have relatively low thermal expansion coefficients,
making the alloys more compatible with lower-expansion porcelains. The silver content is generally low and is not sufficient to
cause significant porcelain “greening.”
The effects of several dental laboratory variables (recasting old
alloy, alternative oxidation cycle, stripping and rebonding of porcelain) on porcelain adherence were investigated for one Pd-Ga
alloy, three Pd-Cu-Ga alloys, and one Au-Pd alloy. One finding was
that remelting two and three times degraded porcelain adherence
to the Pd-Ga alloy and one Pd-Cu-Ga alloy. Stripping of the original porcelain did not cause a significant decrease in adherence of
the subsequently applied porcelain. An alternate oxidation procedure from the one recommended by the manufacturer significantly
affected porcelain adherence to one Pd-Cu-Ga alloy and the Au-Pd
alloy. Therefore where there is doubt, the manufacturer should be

Compared with other alloys for metal-ceramic prostheses, the
base-metal alloys (other than titanium and titanium alloys) generally are harder and stiffer (higher elastic modulus) (Tables 9-4 and
9-5); this enables the coping to be 0.1 to 0.2 mm thick without
risking significant deformation under mastication stress or sagging
of the metal framework at the porcelain-firing temperature. The
higher melting temperatures make these alloys more difficult to
cast than the high-noble and noble alloys.

Manipulation of Base-Metal Alloys
Laboratory technicians fabricating base-metal copings for metalceramic prostheses will face the following technical issues: casting
condition, castability, finishing, and controlling oxide layers. The
fusion temperatures of Ni-Cr and Co-Cr alloys are in the range of
1150 to 1500 °C; an acetylene-oxygen flame or an electrical induction heating source is required for melting these alloys. The mold
should be made of either phosphate- or silicate-bonded investment material, which maintains its surface integrity at the casting
temperature of base-metal alloys. The density of a base-metal alloy
is about half that of a gold-based alloy. The lower density reduces
the force of gravity for bulky maxillary appliances on the supporting teeth but also reduces the thrust generated by the casting unit
to force the molten base-metal alloy to fill the mold. The use of
a vent and a larger sprue size than that used for gold-based alloys
may be needed (Chapter 14, Wax Pattern and Sprue Design).
The castability of Co-Cr alloys is in the same range as that
of Ni-Cr alloys without beryllium. Some noble and high-noble
alloys were found to exhibit lower castability than Co-Cr alloys.
In contrast, a study of the marginal accuracy of a high-noble alloy,
four noble alloys, and a Ni-Cr-Be alloy revealed that for all alloys,
marginal completeness was adequate, and marginal openings were
considerably less than 50 μm. Some researchers claim that all
alloys will theoretically produce complete castings under optimal
burnout, melting, and casting conditions.
In general, the high hardness and high strength of these basemetal alloys contribute to certain difficulties of adjusting prostheses. After casting, it is useful to sandblast the prosthesis to remove
investment materials and excessive oxides. Grinding and polishing
of fixed restorations to achieve proper occlusion will occasionally
require more time at chairside. The removal of defective restorations
may also require more time. The potential hazard of dust generated
from the procedure is a concern and is discussed with the biological
hazards of base-metal alloys (Chapter 17, Dental Alloys).
The solidification shrinkages of base-metal alloys are greater
than those of gold-based alloys, which represents a challenge for
technicians to obtain acceptable-fitting base-metal castings. Using
type V die stone for dies and enhancing the expansion of the
investment mold during the setting of the investment are the most
common practices to improve the fit of prostheses (Chapter 14,
Control of Shrinkage Compensation).
The thickness of the oxide layer and the wetting of the oxide
layer by porcelain are important factors in establishing the bonding

182

PA RT I I I

Indirect Restorative Materials

of porcelain to the metal substrate. For the laboratory technician
to produce optimal metal-oxide characteristics, the manufacturer’s
instructions must be followed precisely. However, some instructions
are relatively imprecise. For example, some alloys require a “light”
sandblasting of the oxide layer formed during the initial oxidation
step. The particle size of aluminum oxide abrasive is generally recommended, but neither the quality of abrasive nor the sandblasting
pressure is usually specified. Contamination of the oxide layer with
lower-purity abrasives could degrade the integrity of the interface
between the metal oxide and the opaque porcelain. The ability of
a laboratory technician to discriminate light from moderate sandblasting to reduce the thickness of these surface oxides is one example of the technique sensitivity of base-metal alloys.

Titanium-Based Alloys
As previously discussed, titanium undergoes a phase transformation at 882 °C and exhibits a high rate of oxidation above
900 °C. Therefore a low-fusing ceramic with a sintering temperature below 800 °C should be used to minimize oxidation
and prevent any phase transformation during sintering. The high
melting temperatures of CP Ti and titanium alloys makes them
highly resistant to sag deformation at porcelain-sintering temperatures, and the accompanying relatively low thermal expansion coefficient demands special low-expansion dental porcelains
for bonding to titanium. Because of the α-case formation, caustic NaOH-based solutions or silicon nitride coatings have been
employed to improve the bond between cast CP Ti and dental
porcelain.
In general, in vitro bonding tests show that metal-ceramics
fabricated from noble and base-metal alloys exhibit higher bond
strengths than those of low-fusing porcelain to titanium. However, a small number of studies show that the bond strengths are
not statistically significantly different between the two groups.
Differences in porcelain composition often require different firing temperatures, which may result in bond-strength changes.
However, there is no difference in porcelain bond strength
between CP Ti and titanium alloys. Studies also show that surface
treatment of CP Ti and titanium alloy before porcelain application can improve the bond strength. The treatments include silica
deposition by magnetron sputtering; deposition of an intermediate metallic layer by silver plating; use of an admixture of titanium particles and porcelain as a bonding agent; incorporation
of an intermediate ceramic layer; nitridation of the titanium surface; and surface roughening by a caustic bath, hydrochloric acid,
or sandblasting. Although multiple firing has no effect on bond
strength, firing in an argon atmosphere, which reduces oxide formation, improves the bond strength. It is believed that controlling the thickness and adherence of the oxide is the key to higher
bond strength.
Properties of high-noble and base-metal alloys (including CP
Ti) for metal-ceramic prostheses are listed in Table 9-10.

Mechanical Properties
The elastic modulus of base-metal alloys is twice as much or greater
than those for noble-metal alloys. This property allows the technician to reduce the cross-sectional area of cast interproximal connectors. The rigidity of the prosthesis is proportional to the elastic
modulus and the connector width (buccal-lingual dimension) but
is proportional to the cube of the connector thickness (occlusalgingival dimension). The cubic relationship with the connector
thickness means that when an alloy with an elastic modulus that
is twice as high is used, the connector thickness can be reduced
by 20.6%, while maintaining the same rigidity of the prosthesis.
Using similar reasoning, a reduction of the coping thickness from
0.3 to 0.1 mm may increase the risk of porcelain fracture because
of the increased coping flexibility. However, a finite-element analysis of stresses induced in anterior metal-ceramic crowns under
intraoral forces indicates that a reduction of base-metal coping
thickness (in veneered areas) from 0.3 to 0.1 mm exhibits only a
slight effect on porcelain stresses.
It is a common practice to design the occlusal surface of
metal-ceramic prostheses to be made from cast metal to avoid
excessive wear of the opposing natural dentition. Compared
with the same prostheses made of high-noble or noble alloys, the
hardness of the base-metal alloys makes the occlusal adjustment
slightly more difficult to perform, and the resulting roughness
can cause greater wear of the opposing tooth enamel. Repair of
crowns with fractured porcelain veneers, which may be simply
performed on noble-metal substrates using pin-retained facings
or metal-ceramic onlays, is more difficult to accomplish when
the failed restoration has a framework cast with a nickel- or
cobalt-based alloy.

Alloys for Removable Partial Dentures
RPDs have four major metal components: connectors, rests,
clasps, and mesh bases. Except for clasps, each component should
be rigid and resist permanent deformation, which suggests a material of high elastic modulus and yield strength. Table 9-11 lists the
compositions and mechanical properties of selected base-metal
alloys for RPDs. The density of these alloys ranges from 7.6 to
8.3 g/cm3. For clasps, the material must be resistant to permanent deformation, flexible to engage undercuts, and possess sufficient ductility to facilitate adjustment without fracture. Ideally,
the clasps should be made of gold-based type 4 alloy because of its
lower elastic modulus, good ductility, and adequate yield strength
(Table 9-4), and then soldered (discussed later) to the remaining
framework made of a base-metal alloy. This arrangement, however, inevitably promotes corrosion at the soldered (brazed) joint
(Chapter 3, Dissimilar Metals). Although gold-based clasps can
be embedded in the denture base resin to avoid corrosion at the
solder joint, in practice, RPDs are cast in one piece using the same
alloy. The effect of the high elastic modulus of the base-metal
alloy on the flexure and retention of the clasps can be adequately
addressed by reducing the clasp thickness. The situation is similar
to that discussed for FDPs.

Predominantly Base-Metal Alloys
Cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy has been the primary
metal for RPD prostheses. Cobalt increases the elastic modulus
and strength. Inclusion of greater than 30% chromium by weight
makes the alloy difficult to cast and forms the brittle σ phase.
Molybdenum and manganese improve the corrosion resistance of
the alloy. Carbide formation provides a high yield strength and

hardness in the alloy but lowers ductility. Particular concerns are
the higher hardness of some alloys, which can cause in vivo wear of
the enamel; the need for special finishing in the dental laboratory;
and the tendency of these alloys to undergo rapid work hardening.
Co-Cr alloy clasps are reported to be too retentive initially and
to slowly lose this retention because of permanent deformation
from repeated seating and removal of the appliance, which correspond to cyclic fatigue conditions. Caution is needed by the dental laboratory technician or the clinician in adjusting clasps on the
cast framework to avoid fracture, even for RPD alloys that exhibit
higher values of percent elongation.
Because of the high melting temperatures, these base-metal
alloys are induction-melted and cast using phosphate- or silicatebonded investments, as recommended by the manufacturer, to
compensate for their high casting shrinkage and to minimize the
potential for casting defects.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Because titanium alloy has an elastic modulus comparable to that of gold,
how can the stiffness of an RPD made from this titanium alloy be increased
to the same level of stiffness as a cobalt-chromium RPD?

Titanium-Based Alloys
CP Ti and titanium alloys have occasionally been used to make
RPD frameworks because of the excellent biocompatibility, outstanding corrosion resistance, and good mechanical properties.
Because of the low elastic modulus, compared with that of basemetal alloys, the rigidity of the connector is often improved by
increasing the thickness or changing the design. Increasing the
rigidity also reduces debonding between the resin base and the

184

metal framework. In addition, the lower yield strength and higher
percent elongation of CP Ti suggest that cast clasps may be easily
adjusted.
Laboratory casting of titanium remains a challenge because
internal porosity within the clasp assemblies can lead to clasp fracture. The reaction layer on the surface must be removed chemically with hydrofluorosilicic acid or mechanically by sandblasting
and rotary instruments.
The strong binding and high electrostatic character of the titanium surface oxide may result in higher plaque adherence to titanium frameworks compared with other base-metal frameworks. A
clinical survey of RPDs revealed gradual discoloration of titanium
alloy frameworks, whereas those made with CP Ti and other basemetal alloys did not discolor. It was hypothesized that aluminum
segregates from the titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) during casting
and corrodes during service; further research is needed to verify
this hypothesis. An in vitro study has also revealed that exposing
titanium alloys to alkaline denture cleansers (pH greater than 11)
causes discoloration. Laser welding of titanium has facilitated the
repair of titanium frameworks because of the low thermal conductivity of titanium and localized heating during laser welding. This
is also true for the Co-Cr and Ni-Cr alloys.

Technologies are currently available for fabricating metallic prostheses without metal melting and the associated casting
shrinkage. Except for RPD frameworks, most metal prostheses
can be made by one or more of the following methods: (1) sintering (or diffusion bonding) of burnished metal foil, (2) CADCAM processing of metal blocks, (3) copy milling of metal blocks,
and (4) electroforming of metal copings. A fifth method, which
has become highly popular worldwide, 3-D printing with selective
laser melting of metal powder, can be used to fabricate most metal
prostheses, including RPD frameworks.

CRITICAL QUESTION
What are the merits and concerns of using alternative techniques other than
casting for fabricating prostheses from dental alloys?

Alternative Technologies for Fabricating
Prostheses
Shrinkage of the dental casting alloy in an investment mold occurs
in three stages: (1) the thermal contraction of the liquid metal
cooling to its liquidus temperature (Figure 2-17), (2) the phase
change from the liquid to the solid state (solidus temperature),
and (3) the thermal contraction of the solid metal from the solidus
temperature to room temperature (Figure 2-17). The linear solidification shrinkage of an alloy resulting from thermal contraction
differs from the casting shrinkage for dental alloys because of the
effect of the investment surrounding the solidifying casting.
The first-stage contraction is of no consequence to the final
dimensions of the casting because the molten metal flows freely and
fills the mold. For the second-stage contraction, the solidification
starts at the walls of the mold, and the first layer of metal tends to
adhere to the mold, while the liquid metal continues to be fed from
the reservoir, which results in no contraction of the casting relative to the investment mold. As the casting cools, it gains sufficient
strength to contract independently of the mold. Any contraction
of the casting from this point will affect the fit of the prosthesis.
Finally, the casting shrinks thermally until it reaches room temperature. Because the thermal contraction coefficient of the metal casting is higher than that of the investment mold, the size of the final
casting will be smaller than that of the investment mold, which is an
accurate reproduction of the missing tooth structure. The difference
in dimensions is called casting shrinkage and normally is compensated for by the setting and thermal expansion of the investment
used (Chapter 14, Investment Materials). Table 9-12 lists the linear
solidification shrinkage of various alloys cast as smooth cylinders.
Because the contraction of the alloy as it cools to room temperature
dominates the casting shrinkage, the higher-melting alloys tend to
exhibit greater shrinkage.

Sintering of Burnished Foil
The most commonly used commercial foil system, Captek (Leach
& Dillon, North Attleboro, MA), is used for making copings or
frameworks for metal-ceramic prostheses. The protocol and guidelines for the Captek system are found in an article in the Selected
Readings section. The main advantage of Captek crowns is their
very low thickness, which ensures minimal tooth reduction or
improved esthetics compared with conventional metal-ceramic
crowns made with cast metal copings. For the construction of a
multiple-unit FDP, a connector for the two abutment copings is
waxed and cast with a recommended gold alloy. The copings are
then joined with the connector using furnace soldering, electrical
welding, or laser welding before the porcelain application.

CAD-CAM Processing
The dental application of CAD-CAM became available in the early
1980s to produce ceramic inlays and crowns during one chairside
appointment. This technology has been improved and expanded,
and computer-aided milling or grinding of a metal or a ceramic
block can be performed accurately by a CAD-CAM process or by
electrolytic or electrical discharge removal of metal. The CAD-CAM
technique can be used to prepare prostheses from CP Ti or titanium
alloy, which do not contain bulk casting defects or the hard α case
found near the surface of cast titanium prostheses. More about the
CAD-CAM process is provided in Chapter 15, Prototyping Tools.

Copy Milling
The copy-milling process is based on the principle of tracing the
surface of a resin prosthesis pattern, which is then replicated on
a blank of ceramic, composite, or metal that is ground, cut, or
milled by a rotating wheel whose motion is controlled by a link
through the tracing device. The process is similar to that associated
with cutting a key blank using a tracing of a master key. One commercial system of this type (Celay, Mikrona Technologies, Spreitenbach, Switzerland) has been in use since 1991. The pattern

CHAPTER 9

to be traced is made from a blue-colored, resin-based composite
(Celay-Tech, ESPE, Seefeld/Oberbayern, Germany).

Electroforming
A master cast of the prepared tooth (teeth) is prepared and coated
with a special die spacer to facilitate separation of the duplicating
material. The dies are duplicated with a gypsum product that has a
setting expansion of 0.1% to 0.2%. After a conductive silver layer
is applied to its surface, the die is connected to a plating head, and
then to a power source and placed in a plating solution. After a
sufficiently thick layer of gold or other metal is deposited, the gypsum is removed, and the coping is sandblasted. The coping is then
coated with a bonding agent during the wash bake, and subsequent
ceramic layers are condensed and sintered in a conventional way.
As is true for the burnished foil system, a cast pontic is needed
for joining electroformed copings to construct multiple-unit
prostheses.

the CAD-CAM milling method, and (4) the direct laser metal
sintering method. Initial results indicate that the best fit was
exhibited by group 4, followed by groups 2, 1, and 3. A review
published in 2020 shows that the total gap of single-crown soft
milling had the highest accuracy, and for multi-unit FDPs, additive manufactured restorations had the highest accuracy.

There are three categories of metal-joining operations: soldering,
brazing, and welding. The soldering and brazing processes for the
metallic components (also called substrate metals) to be joined
always employ a filler metal (usually called solder), along with a
flux and a heat source. Brazing is conducted above 450 °C, and
soldering is conducted below that temperature. Both processes are
performed below the solidus temperature of the substrate metal
or metals; there is no melting at the workpiece surfaces. The term
soldering is used in this section as a general term to describe both
processes. Welding may not require a filler metal because the
metal surfaces to be joined melt and fuse locally. The common
characteristic of these operations is the achievement of bonding
between the workpieces and/or the filler metals by a controlled
heating procedure.
Metal-joining processes in dentistry have traditionally been
dominated by the gold-based alloys, and soldering (or brazing)
using a flame torch has been the main process. With the newer
nongold alloys, the requirements of the metal-joining process differ among the alloys used. For example, titanium alloys oxidize
readily at elevated temperatures, and an oxygen-free environment
and a nonoxygen heating source are needed.
Spot welding based on electrical resistance has been used to
weld alloys of low thermal conductivity, such as orthodontic
appliances. New advances in the technology of heating sources
have been adapted for orthodontic and other dental applications.
They include the plasma torch, Nd:YAG laser, and tungsten-inert
gas (TIG) arc. The advantages of these technologies are that the
area of heating is small—it can be 0.2 mm with the laser and
TIG—and the duration of heating can be controlled. When the
area of heating is very small, the thermal conductivity of the alloy
can be of concern. High thermal conduction dissipates the thermal energy needed for melting the substrate metal. The very small
area of heating is advantageous for Co-Cr and titanium alloys,
which have lower thermal conductivities than gold-based alloys.
Although the advantages of modern heating sources have
shifted the operation of metal joining in dental laboratories
toward welding, gold soldering is a simpler procedure that can be
conducted in the dental office.

CRITICAL QUESTION

Three-Dimensional Printing
The process of 3-D printing is a form of additive manufacturing
technology where a 3-D object is created by depositing successive layers of material. This technology is now being widely used
with metal powders to fabricate dental restorations and prostheses. As described in Chapter 15, Additive Manufacturing—
3D Printing, the metal powder is first spread across the working
platform. A laser traces the outline of each part being printed,
and metal powder is fused to the layer below it. As the platform
is lowered, a new layer of material is spread across the platform,
and the process is repeated until the printing process is completed. This process is called selective laser melting or direct laser
metal sintering. For dental applications, the metal powder can be
titanium, Co-Cr alloy, or a noble metal. The powder compositions for two Co-Cr alloys used for selective laser melting are
shown in Table 9-13, and it can be seen that these powder compositions are very similar to the compositions of the base-metal
casting alloys shown in Table 9-11. Additional technologies are
discussed in Chapter 15, Prototyping Tools.

three-unit Co-Cr-based FDPs using four fabrication techniques:

Soldering Flux
A metal surface free of any contaminant, such as oxides, is essential for establishing metallic bonds between substrate metals. A
flux is needed, and it has three primary functions: (1) dissolve
surface oxides, (2) reduce existing oxides to pure elements, and (3)

186

PA RT I I I

protect the surface from oxidation during soldering. The solder
chosen must wet the metal substrate to be joined. To prevent the
flow of molten solder onto adjacent areas, an antiflux, such as
rouge mixed with chloroform or graphite, can be painted on these
areas before heating the substrate metals.
Fluxes for use with noble-metal alloys are generally based on
boric acid, boric anhydride, and borax. Chromium oxides that
form on base-metal alloys are more stable, and fluoride-containing
fluxes are needed to dissolve chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides.
Fluxes are also available for different temperature ranges to provide optimal activity.
The amount of flux used should be minimized because entrapment of flux within the filler metal can cause a weakened joint.
Residual flux that is covered with porcelain can cause discoloration
and bubbling of the porcelain. Flux combines with metal oxides
and forms a glass during the soldering process, and the residue
should be removed. After the soldering process, sandblasting the
joint with alumina abrasive particles immediately after removal
from the soldering investment and boiling in water are needed to
remove glassy residue resulting from the reaction between the flux
and oxides.

Filler Metal for Soldering
The filler metals should have acceptable color, adequate hardness
and strength, and tarnish and corrosion resistance relative to the
workpieces. Fillers and substrates do not need to have similar
compositions, but the filler metals should have (1) a sufficiently
low flow temperature, (2) the ability to wet the substrate metal,
and (3) sufficient fluidity at the flow temperature.

Flow Temperature
When the filler metal melts, wets, and flows on the substrate metal,
it bonds to this workpiece. The flow temperature of the filler metal
is usually higher than its liquidus temperature to provide suitable
viscosity and must be sufficiently lower than the solidus temperature
of the substrate metal that melting of the substrate does not occur.
For an alloy substrate that will be veneered with porcelain after soldering, the melting range of the filler metal should be higher than
the sintering temperature of the porcelain to avoid sag deformation
of the bridge framework during subsequent porcelain firing.
Wetting
Recall the discussion of the role of wetting in Chapter 2, Wetting.
Wetting of the substrate metal by the molten filler metal is essential
to produce a metallic bond. Oxides have poor wettability characteristics; therefore molten metal does not spread on the oxide layer
of substrate metals. That is the reason why iron oxide is used as
antiflux.
Fluidity
Molten filler metals should flow freely into the gap between the
two substrate metals. When the surface of a metal prosthesis needs
to be extended, such as for a deficient interproximal contact area,
a filler metal can be used to build up the area. A filler metal with
relatively sluggish fluidity then becomes desirable. This type of
filler usually has a wide melting range, and flow can be controlled
to well-defined areas.

Heat Sources for Soldering
The most common instrument for the application of heat is a gasair or gas-oxygen torch. All gases shown in Table 9-14 have potential flame temperatures high enough to melt any dental casting
alloy currently in use. The thermal energy (heat content measured
in calories per cubic meter of the fuel) from the combustion of
the fuel must not only raise the temperature of both the substrate
metal and the filler metal to the soldering temperature but also
compensate for heat loss to the surroundings. Fuel with a lower
heat content requires a longer period of heating at the desired temperature and is associated with an increased danger of oxidation
during the soldering process.
Of the fuel gases in Table 9-14, the best choice is propane.
Butane, which is more readily available in some parts of the world,
has a similar flame temperature and heat content as propane. Both
propane and butane have the advantage of being relatively pure
compounds; therefore they are uniform in quality, are virtually
water-free, and burn cleanly (provided that the torch flame is
properly adjusted). With acetylene, which should only be used by
an experienced dental laboratory technician, concerns are localized
variations in flame temperature and the tendency for decomposition into carbon and hydrogen, with the incorporation of carbon
in both nickel and palladium solders degrading the mechanical
properties of the joints.
Another source of heating is a furnace that heats the assembled
substrate metals along with flux and solder deposited at the joining site to an appropriate temperature for melting and flow of
solder. Before the assembled substrate metals are placed into the
oven, a uniform coating of a paste flux should be applied to the
surface to be soldered. The advantage of furnace soldering is that
every component can be heated and cooled uniformly in accordance with a precise schedule that prevents distortion, which
might occur under localized heating, such as during soldering of
metal-ceramic bridges.

CRITICAL QUESTIONS
Which type of torch gas should be used for soldering noble alloys? Why is it
not possible to use all torch gases?

Technique Considerations for Soldering
For fixed prostheses, where accurate alignment is needed, investment soldering is used, in which the parts to be joined are first
indexed and joined by a temporary material, such as acrylic resin
or sticky wax, and then mounted in a soldering investment, which
holds the parts together during the soldering procedure. In contrast, freehand soldering is used for assembling orthodontic and

some other appliances, in which the parts to be joined are manually held in contact during the soldering procedure. As soon as
the filler metal has flowed to the desired position, the heating is
discontinued, and the appliance is cooled.
The investment soldering technique involves several critical steps: (1) cleaning and preparing the surfaces to be joined,
(2) assembling the parts to be joined, (3) preparation and fluxing of the gap surfaces between the parts, (4) maintaining the
proper position of the parts during the procedure, (5) control of
the proper temperature, and (6) control of the time to ensure adequate flow of solder and complete filling of the solder joint. Many
of these steps are applicable to freehand soldering.
Other factors that may influence the result of soldering are discussed next.

Gap Width
The gap between the parts of the substrate metal to be joined must
be sufficient to allow solder flow between the workpieces. If the gap
is too great, the joint strength will be dictated by the strength of the
filler metal. If the gap is too narrow, flux inclusions and porosity
caused by incomplete flow of the filler metal may occur and lead
to decreased strength. Inclusions or porosity can lead to distortion
if any heating, such as porcelain application, takes place after the
soldering operation. The ideal gap width is about 0.13 mm.
Flame
A torch flame can be divided into four zones, as shown in
Figure 9-4. The portion of the flame used to heat the soldering
assembly should be the tip of the reducing zone, in which the
most efficient burning process occurs and the most heat is generated. An improperly adjusted torch or improperly positioned
flame can lead to oxidation of the substrate or filler metal and
result in a poor solder joint. It is also possible to introduce carbon
into the substrate and filler metal by using the unburned gas portion of the flame. To prevent oxidation, the flame should not be
removed once it has been applied to the joint area until the soldering process has been completed. The flame provides protection
from oxidation, especially at the soldering temperature.
Temperature and Time
The flame or furnace chamber should provide enough heat to the
substrate metal to reach the flow temperature of the filler metal.
Then the substrate metal will be hot enough to melt the filler
metal as soon as it contacts the area to be joined.
Temperature and time control the diffusion of atoms across
the filler–substrate interface. Alloying can take place by diffusion if the temperature remains constant for a sufficiently long
time. An alloy formed at the interface of the substrate metal
and filler metal through diffusion can have properties different from those of the filler metal and the substrate metal.

• Figure 9-5 Joining of two different substrate metals with the filler metal
(in center). Left, Good bonding with no alloying between the filler metal
and substrate metal. Right, A nodular region of alloying that has occurred
at the interface between the filler metal and another substrate alloy, which
is not distinct in this micrograph. (Courtesy Clyde E. Ingersoll.)

Figure 9-5 shows such a soldered joint between two different
substrate metals. On the left side, the filler–substrate interface
is represented by a sharply defined plane. On the right side,
the substrate metal appears to have alloyed with the solder at
the joint surface adjacent to the nodular area (to the right of the
solder boundary).
Therefore the flame should be maintained in place until the
filler metal has flowed completely into the connection and a short
time longer to allow the flux or oxide to separate from the fluid
filler metal.

CRITICAL QUESTION
What kind of heating source and surrounding environment are needed for
joining titanium components?

Laser Welding of Commercially Pure Titanium
As previously noted, CP Ti is a highly reactive metal that oxidizes
readily in air. At temperatures used for soldering procedures, the
thickness of the titanium oxide layer increases, and it may spontaneously debond from the parent metal surface at temperatures
exceeding 850 °C. Thus the quality of the soldered joint is quite
variable if a traditional torch-soldering or oven-soldering procedure is used.

188

PA RT I I I

Indirect Restorative Materials

Laser welding in an argon atmosphere is a method of choice
for joining titanium components of dental prostheses because
the coherent, high-intensity laser light can be focused on a small
region and melt the substrate without extensive microstructural
damage to the surrounding areas. An advantage of welding is
that the joint will be composed of the same pure titanium as the
substrate components, thereby preserving the excellent biocompatibility potential of CP Ti and avoiding the risk of galvanic corrosion effects within the prosthesis.

Wrought Alloys and Plastic Deformation of
Metals
The term wrought alloys refers to solid cast alloys that have been
mechanically shaped to specific configurations. The process causes
alteration of the cast alloy microstructures and results in significant
changes in the mechanical properties. The most notable changes
are the increase of the yield strength or proportional limit with a
reduction of ductility. This segment reviews the crystal structure
of alloys, describes mechanisms of plastic deformation, and identifies correlations between microstructural features and mechanical
properties.

Theoretical and Observed Shear Strengths of
Metals
An atomic model illustrating permanent deformation of a metal
having a perfect crystalline structure subjected to an applied shear
stress is shown in Figure 9-6. Notice that the deformation or slip
process requires the simultaneous displacement of plane 1 atoms
relative to the plane 2 atoms. Studies have shown that theoretical shear strengths are much higher than those observed from
mechanical testing of polycrystalline metals. For example, the differences for copper is about 35 times (7.7 GPa vs. 220 MPa), and
iron is about 44 times (12.8 GPa vs. 290 MPa). The difference can
be as much as 190 times greater for the ceramic SiC (31.8 GPa vs.
170 MPa). In contrast to polycrystalline materials, monocrystalline whisker specimens, which are short fibrous single crystals of
metals or ceramics that achieve near perfect atomic lattice, exhibit
shear strengths approaching their theoretical values. The key difference between whiskers and polycrystalline specimens of the
same material is the presence of crystal imperfections at the atomic
level in the polycrystalline material.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Why are the observed strengths of metals always lower than the theoretical
strengths?

Crystal Imperfections
Recall Figure 2-16, which illustrates an ideal crystallization that
leads to a polycrystalline structure. In reality, the growth is likely
to be random and imperfect. When lattice positions have missing
atoms, displaced atoms, or extra atoms, these sites are called point
defects. The edge of an extra plane of atoms in the crystal is called

crystal are considered two-dimensional (2-D) imperfections in the
crystal.

Point Defects
Point defects are very localized disruptions in the regularity of a
lattice (Figure 9-7). A vacancy or vacant atom site in a crystalline
lattice may occur at a single site in the atomic arrangement. Foreign atoms may be present on the lattice by substituting the lattice
site atoms and are known as substitutional defects in the crystal
structure of pure metal. The size of substitutional atom may be
larger or smaller than that of the normal atom in the lattice. An
interstitial defect is produced if smaller-size atoms (such as, H, B,
C, N, O) is present in the interstitial site. The vacancies provide
the principal mechanism for atomic diffusion in crystalline materials. The mechanical properties of metals are also sensitive to the
presence of point defects because of their interactions with dislocations discussed in the following section.

Line Defects (Dislocations)
The simplest type of line defect or dislocation, known as an
edge dislocation, is illustrated in Figure 9-8, A for a simple cubic
structure. It can be noted that the atomic arrangement is regular
except for the single vertical plane of atoms that is discontinuous. The edge dislocation (symbolized by ⊥) is located at the
edge of the partial plane. If the atoms have a helical arrangement around the dislocation line (analogous to spiral ramps in
a parking garage), such arrangement is called screw dislocation
(Figure 9-9).
If a sufficiently large shear stress is applied across the top and
bottom faces of the crystal containing the edge dislocation shown
in Figure 9-8, A, the bonds in the row of atoms adjacent to the
dislocation will be broken, and new bonds with the next row will
be established, resulting in movement of the dislocation by one
interatomic distance, as indicated in Figure 9-8, B. Continued
application of this shear stress causes similar movements of one
interatomic distance until the dislocation reaches the boundary of
the crystal (Figure 9-8, C). The plane along which an edge dislocation moves is known as a slip plane. The result of this dislocation
movement across the crystal is that the atomic planes on one side
of the slip plane have been displaced one interatomic spacing with
respect to the atomic planes on the other side of the slip plane. The
crystallographic direction in which the atomic planes have been

Screw dislocation

displaced is termed the slip direction, and the combination of a slip
plane and a slip direction is termed a slip system. The screw dislocation is more difficult to visualize than the edge dislocation and is
discussed in textbooks on engineering materials science. Dislocations in metallic materials often have a mixed character, consisting
of both edge and screw components.

The inherent ability of a metal to deform plastically and exhibit
ductility increases with the number of slip systems associated
with the crystal structure. The number of slip systems in common crystal structures is in the decreasing order of face-centered
cubic (FCC; e.g., gold, silver, copper, nickel), body-centered cubic
(BCC, e.g., α-iron, chromium), and then hexagonal close-packed
(e.g., cobalt, zinc).
Evidently, much less shear stress is required to initiate permanent deformation of the metal crystals that contain edge dislocations (Figure 9-8) because only one row of atomic bonds along the
slip plane is broken at a time, compared with the perfect crystal,
where atomic bonds across the entire slip plane (Figure 9-6) must
be simultaneously broken for shear deformation to occur. The proportional limit for a metal generally corresponds to the onset of
significant movement of dislocations. The slip lines in Figure 9-10
correspond to slip planes where large numbers of dislocations have
exited the metal, causing surface offsets that scatter the light used
for observation. Thus one can conclude that permanent deformation of a metal is the result of dislocation movement and slip
between atomic planes.

CRITICAL QUESTION
What fundamental strengthening mechanisms are available for alloys that are
not possible for pure metals?

Figures 9-8 and 9-11, A illustrate one dislocation moving in a pure
metal crystal; it appears that there is little hindrance of a moving
dislocation along its slip plane. In reality, there are several scenarios in which dislocation movement can be impeded in pure metals
and alloys. Alloys contain multiple phases, such as solid solutions
and/or precipitates (Chapter 2, Liquid-to-Solid Transformation of
Cast Metals), in addition to the numerous dislocations and grain

taken from the top of the three-dimensional (3-D) model shown in Figure 9-8. Each line with right-pointing
arrows represents a line defect (dislocation) moving toward the right side of the grain. A, A dislocation
moves without any impediment within a grain; no extra effort is needed, and no strengthening effect occurs. B, The blue and slightly larger sphere represents a solute atom or coherent precipitate that presents
an obstacle to the movement of the dislocation; bending of the line defect implies that the movement has
been impeded, and more stress is needed to pass through the obstacle. C, The dark spheres represent
incoherent precipitates, and the background simulates the rest of the grain. The dislocation cannot pass
through the incoherent precipitate because it does not share the same lattice with the hosting grain. The
first dislocation (left) bends as it moves close to the precipitate. The second dislocation (middle) continues
to bend around the precipitate, while the rest of the dislocation keeps moving toward the right. Finally, the
dislocation (right) completes its encircling around the precipitate; the rest of the dislocation rejoins and
moves on through the nonstrengthened area.

CHAPTER 9

boundaries found in pure metals. These crystal structural features
represent obstacles that may be overcome by an application of
increased stress to promote dislocation movement.
For solid-solution alloys, the atomic arrangement near solute
atoms is locally distorted. The movement of dislocations along
the slip plane will be impeded by the presence of such solute
atoms (Figure 9-11, B). Precipitates can be coherent, where the
atomic bonds are continuous across the interface with the solidsolution matrix, or incoherent, where interatomic bonds are not
continuous across the interface. Coherent precipitates have the
same crystal structure as the matrix phase and generate localized
distortion in the atomic arrangement. Dislocations cannot
move through incoherent precipitates but instead form loops
of increasing size around these particles (Figure 9-11, C). Additional stress is needed to move dislocations through distorted
regions, including coherent precipitates, or around incoherent
precipitates.
Metals with a sufficient amount of ductility can be permanently deformed under mechanical stress at temperatures below
their recrystallization temperatures (including room temperature), as discussed later. This process, also known as cold working,
can create vast numbers of point defects and dislocations within
the metals. These dislocations will interact with each other, mutually impeding their movements. Increased stress is required for
further dislocation movement to continue the permanent deformation process.
The movement of a dislocation from one grain into another
grain is unlikely, especially if the adjacent grain is misaligned
(Figure 9-12). Grain boundaries represent the ends of slip
planes where dislocations cease to move and accumulate. As
the grain size decreases, there will be more grain boundary area
per unit volume to impede dislocation motion. Grain size can
be controlled by rapid cooling or quenching or by the inclusion of a grain-refining element (Chapter 2, Grain Refinement
and Grain Size), such as iridium in gold alloys. Cold working
also alters the shapes of grains substantially (e.g., the grains are
severely elongated parallel to the wire axis).

A higher stress, which is reflected in higher values of proportional limit, is needed for dislocations to overcome each impeding
mechanism to continue moving along the slip plane. Therefore
these obstacles are considered mechanisms for the strengthening
of metal alloys that include solid-solution strengthening, precipitation hardening, strain (or work) hardening, and grain-refinement strengthening. The elastic moduli of the wrought alloys
remain the same as those of their cast counterparts because there
are no changes in the crystalline structure. If a phase change has
occurred in the alloy in the process, some change in the elastic
modulus is expected.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Why does the clasp of an RPD fracture easily after a patient has bent it back
and forth repeatedly to relieve discomfort?

Effects of Strengthening Metals
The ductility of the wrought alloys is decreased with each of the
strengthening mechanisms just described. The corrosion resistance
of the wrought alloys is also decreased because the dislocations
produce localized regions of strain at the atomic level, which have
higher energy than atomic arrangements in the undeformed metal.
Corrosion is a process that relieves stored energy (Chapter 3, Stress
Corrosion), and it can be minimized by stress relief (discussed
later).
One can observe from the first row of photomicrographs of
Figure 9-13 that the thinner the specimen becomes from rolling,
as designated above each photomicrograph, the flatter or thinner
the grains appear to be. Although brass is used in this example,
the same effect would occur with wrought dental alloys. For the
extreme example of a wire, the grains will be elongated parallel to
the wire axis and resemble “strands of spaghetti” in a photomicrograph showing a longitudinal section.
Recall the example we used in the introduction of Chapter 4
regarding the adjustment of the retentive clasps. We can conclude
that the crystal deformation generates dislocations, which can be
moved with finger pressure on the clasp. The movements of the
dislocations allow us to shape the clasp as needed. The region near
the missing half-plane of the edge dislocation can be thought of as
a linear vacancy within the crystal structure. These regions accumulate when there is an edge dislocation pileup at a grain boundary
and grow to a flaw of critical size. Meanwhile, greater force is needed
to overcome obstacles within the alloy. Eventually, the force applied
is high enough to cause crack propagation, and then fracture.

CRITICAL QUESTION

Slip plane

What is the difference between the twinning and dislocation-movement
mechanisms of plastic deformation?

Grain B
Grain A

• Figure 9-12 This illustration shows the spatial lattices of two adjacent
grains. Notice that the lattices are not aligned. There is a dislocation moving toward the grain boundary in grain A. Because of misalignment, the
dislocation in grain A cannot move into grain B and is trapped at the grain
boundary. In essence, the grain boundary is an obstacle to dislocation
movement. Therefore the greater the number of grain boundaries, the
higher is the yield strength of the material.

Plastic Deformation Without Dislocation
Movement
An alternative mode of permanent deformation in metals is twinning. Twinning refers to the atomic arrangement within a crystal
where a region takes on a special orientation from the adjacent
crystal; the two different orientations are crystallographically identical, as if they are reflections across a mirror plane. This boundary
between the original and the new orientation is called a twinning
plane (Figure 9-14, A). The portion having a lattice orientation

• Figure 9-13 Grain size and appearance of brass (copper 66%, zinc 34%) after cold working and annealing. Note that as the degree of cold working increases (to the right in the figure), the grains become more
distorted. When the recrystallization proceeds, the grain size is inversely proportional to the degree of cold
working (×40). (Prepared by L. H. DeWald.)

that is different from the original orientation is called a twin.
Twinning can occur in a metal either during solidification, as
shown in Figure 9-14, A, or as a result of being stressed to a state
of permanent deformation (Figure 9-14, B).
The stress needed to twin a crystal tends to be higher than
that required for slip (Figure 9-6). Therefore slip is the normal
permanent deformation mechanism. Twinning is the favored
mechanism at high strain rates and at low temperatures, rather
than dislocation movement, in metals having relatively few
slip systems. One should note that permanent deformation by
twinning is merely a reorientation of the lattice, and although
the atoms in the twinned portion have moved, their positions
relative to each other remain unchanged. On the other hand,
permanent deformation by slip occurs along individual lattice
planes for which the positions of atoms relative to each other
have changed.
Twinning has significance for the permanent deformation of
α-titanium alloys, which are highly important for some dental

implants and are gaining interest for cast restorations. In the
unit cell for α-titanium, the ratio of the lattice parameter (c)
in the perpendicular direction to the basal plane and the lattice parameter (a) in the basal plane (see Figure 2-9, G), which
is known as the c/a ratio, is slightly less than the ideal value of
1.633 for the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure, which
results in additional slip planes and the tendency to undergo
twinning readily. Twinning is also the mechanism for reversible
transformation between the austenitic and martensitic structures
in nickel-titanium orthodontic wires, which has considerable
clinical significance.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Why must recrystallization of orthodontic wires be avoided when a stressrelief heat treatment is performed after manipulation to minimize fracture
during placement?

Effects of Annealing Wrought Alloys
The effects associated with permanent deformation (e.g., strain
hardening, decreased ductility, distorted grains, and increased
dislocation density) can be reversed by simply heating the metal
to an appropriate elevated temperature without melting it. This
process is called annealing, and it takes place in three successive
stages: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The more
severe the degree of cold working, the more rapidly the effects can
be reversed by annealing. Also, the higher the melting point of the
metal, the higher is the temperature needed for annealing.

Recovery
Heating increases atom diffusion and the initiation of annealing. As
Figure 9-15 shows, there is a very slight decrease in tensile strength
and no change in ductility during the recovery stage, which reduces
the number of dislocations and relieves the internal strain energy
resulting from cold working. Orthodontic appliances fabricated by
bending wires are often subjected to a stress-relief anneal prior to
their placement. This heat treatment stabilizes the configuration
of the appliance and allows an accurate determination of the force
that the appliance can deliver in the mouth. The elimination of
residual stresses in the appliance also reduces the likelihood of fracture during clinical adjustments. It is essential that this heat treatment be performed in the recovery-temperature range and not at
higher temperatures where recrystallization occurs.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Why does the process of recrystallization cause a significant reduction in the
tensile strength of the alloy?

Recrystallization
The recrystallization process involves a radical change in the microstructure, as seen in the second and third rows of Figure 9-13.
The atoms at this stage are rearranged into a lower-energy

configuration. The old, distorted grains disappear as new strainfree grains emerge. After completion of recrystallization, the
alloy retains microstructures resembling that before cold working
(upper-left corner of Figure 9-13) and essentially attains its original soft, ductile condition (Figure 9-15). That is the reason why
recrystallization must be avoided during the stress-relief heat treatment of orthodontic appliances. If a metal is not sufficiently coldworked, recrystallization may not occur during a typical annealing
process.
The average grain size of the recrystallized structure depends
on the degree of cold working; the greater is the number of such
nuclei. The greater the degree of cold working, the smaller is the
grain size after recrystallization.

Grain Growth
The grain size increases when the cold-worked alloy is annealed
at an elevated temperature (Figure 9-13, row 4 to row 6). This
increase in grain size is called grain growth, which is a process by
which the volume of the grain boundary is reduced; large grains
grow at the expense of small grains. Grain growth does not proceed indefinitely to yield a single crystal; rather, it ceases after a
relatively coarse grain structure has been produced.

Types of Wrought Alloys
Wrought alloys are used as wires by orthodontists for correcting
displacements of teeth from proper occlusion and by prosthodontists and general dentists as clasps for the retention and stabilization of RPDs. Wrought alloys are also made in the form of files
and reamers for endodontists to clean and shape root canals or as
prefabricated metal crowns for pedodontic patients.
Orthodontic wires are formed into various configurations or
appliances to apply forces to move the teeth to a more desirable
alignment. From the orthodontic viewpoint, as demonstrated by
the loading of a cantilever beam (Figure 9-16), the proportional
limit (or yield strength) reflects the maximal amount of force a
particular beam design can deliver. The elastic deflection (δ) of

metals selected (i.e., elastic modulus and proportional limit) and
the dimensions of the beam (i.e., thickness, width, radius, and
length). Thus, finding the optimal design for an appliance that
will deliver the low, constant forces, which are biologically desirable for tooth movement, is possible. Practically, the working
range of a material is considered to be the elastic strain at the yield
strength (YS) of the wire, which is termed springback and defined
as YS/E. The mechanical principles described here also apply to
the design of retentive clasps and root canal files and reamers.
Wrought alloys used in dentistry, which include stainless steel,
cobalt-chromium-nickel, nickel-titanium, and beta-titanium, are
now discussed.

What are the differences in the martensitic structures that form in plain

a cantilever beam under a load reflects the extent of tooth displacement that the designed appliance can deliver. The maximum
elastic deflection is reached when the stress approaches the proportional limit and is called the working range of the beam. An
obvious benefit of wrought wires is that they have a greater working range than their cast counterparts.
Physiologically, excessive forces acting on the tooth may cause
root resorption, and insufficient forces yield no tooth movement.
A properly designed orthodontic appliance applies appropriate
amounts of force to the teeth. As the teeth move, the deflection of
the device decreases. In response to the reduction in elastic deflection of the appliance, the level of force applied to the teeth is gradually reduced below the threshold level. When this happens, the
appliance must be reactivated to increase the force level to its original value. Reactivation requires partial permanent deformation to
obtain a suitable configuration for moving the teeth effectively.
The relationships for rectangular and round wires in Figure 9-16
show that the elastic deflection (δ) depends on the properties of

Stainless Steel Alloys
The metallurgy and terminology of stainless steels are closely
related to the binary iron-carbon system, which yields the primary
phases of carbon steel. Therefore a brief outline of the carbon
steels is presented here.

Carbon Steel
Carbon steels can be described simply as iron-carbon binary alloys
that contain less than about 2.1% of carbon by weight. At room
temperature, pure iron has a bcc structure that transforms into
an FCC structure at 912 °C. The solubility of carbon in BCC
iron reaches a maximum of 0.02%, and this material is known
as ferrite. The solid solution of carbon in FCC iron is called austenite, which has a maximal solubility of about 2.1% carbon. All
carbon-steel compositions have the austenite structure at elevated
temperatures.
When a plain carbon steel (only iron and carbon) containing
0.8% carbon is cooled slowly in the austenitic phase to 723 °C,
a solid-state eutectoid transformation occurs to yield a microstructural constituent called pearlite, which consists of alternating

CHAPTER 9

fine-scale lamellae of ferrite and iron carbide (Fe3C). The Fe3C
phase is much harder and more rigid than austenite or ferrite.
At temperatures below 723 °C, when the carbon content is less
than 0.8%, the carbon-steel microstructure consists of ferrite and
pearlite, whereas plain carbon steels containing more than 0.8%
carbon are much harder alloys, with microstructures consisting of
iron carbide and pearlite.
If austenite is cooled very rapidly (quenched), spontaneous
transformation from the FCC structure to a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure results in a new phase called martensite,
which is very hard, strong, and brittle. The transformation occurs
by small atomic displacements and does not involve elemental diffusion. The high hardness of martensite allows the grinding of
a sharp edge, which is retained in extended use. Martensite is a
metastable phase that transforms to ferrite and iron carbide when
it is heated to elevated temperatures. This process is called tempering; it reduces the hardness of the alloy but increases its toughness.

Types of Stainless Steels
When approximately 12% to 30% chromium by weight is added
to carbon steel, the alloy is commonly known as stainless steel.
The chromium in base-metal alloys forms a very thin, transparent, adherent layer of Cr2O3, termed a passivating oxide, which
prevents corrosion of the underlying alloy. If the oxide layer is
ruptured by mechanical or chemical means, the passivating oxide
layer eventually forms again in an oxidizing environment, such as
ambient air.
Based on the previously described crystal structures formed by
iron and carbon atoms, there are three major types of stainless steels:
Ferritic Stainless Steels. These alloys provide good corrosion
resistance at a low cost. They cannot be hardened by heat treatment or readily work-hardened. Consequently, they have little
application in dentistry.
Martensitic Stainless Steels. These alloys can be heat-treated
in the same manner as plain carbon steels, which results in a
high yield strength and hardness for use in surgical and cutting
instruments.
Austenitic Stainless Steels. The addition of nickel stabilizes the
austenite phase on cooling of the alloy. The austenitic stainless
steels are the most corrosion resistant of the three major types.
Austenitic stainless steel is preferred for dental applications
because it has the following properties: (1) greater ductility for
more cold working without fracturing, (2) greater strength from
cold work, (3) greater ease of welding, (4) ability to overcome
sensitization, (5) less critical grain growth, and (6) comparative
ease of reshaping.
The foregoing three classifications of stainless steels, with
approximate compositions, are presented in Table 9-15.

CRITICAL QUESTIONS
How does austenitic stainless steel acquire its corrosion resistance? Can this
protection be lost during the fabrication and normal use of a stainless-steel
appliance?

Corrosion Resistance of Austenitic Stainless Steel
Stainless steel can corrode under the conditions described in
Chapter 3, Stress Corrosion. For example, severe strain hardening produces highly stressed regions that are anodic to less

stressed regions in the presence of saliva. Organic or inorganic
deposits and any site of surface roughness on a metal may result
in localized concentration cell corrosion. Therefore a stainless-steel orthodontic appliance should be polished so that it
remains clean and less susceptible to tarnish or corrosion during use. When a stainless-steel wire or a stainless-steel appliance is abraded or cut with a carbon steel bur or similar steel
tool, carbon steel debris from these tools becomes embedded in
the stainless-steel surface, causing dissimilar metal corrosion in
vivo. Chlorine-containing cleansers should not be used to clean
removable appliances fabricated from stainless steel.
When austenitic stainless steel is heated to between approximately 400 °C and 900 °C, chromium carbides precipitate along
the grain boundaries, causing chromium near the grain boundaries to be depleted below the concentrations necessary for corrosion protection, which also weakens the alloy. This phenomenon
is called sensitization; the stainless steel has become susceptible to
intergranular corrosion. The temperature range of sensitization is
within that used by the orthodontist for soldering and welding. In
addition, filler materials that are employed for brazed or soldered
joints in orthodontic appliances can also form galvanic couples
in vivo.
The manufacturer can reduce the carbon content of the
stainless steel to such an extent that carbide precipitation cannot occur or can severely cold work and heat the stainless steel
within the sensitization temperature range to spread the formation of chromium carbide precipitates within the bulk grains
instead of only at the grain boundaries. Elements such as titanium and tantalum, which preferentially form carbides, can be
added to the stainless steel to preserve the level of chromium
when the metal is exposed to elevated temperatures. This process
is called stabilization.

Mechanical Properties of Austenitic Stainless Steel
The approximate values of the mechanical properties of a representative stainless-steel orthodontic wire are listed in Table 9-16.
Strength and hardness may increase with a decrease in cross-sectional dimensions because of the increased cold working that is
required for forming smaller wires.
It is unfortunate that a stainless-steel orthodontic wire can
become fully annealed (recrystallized) after a few seconds at temperatures from 700 °C to 800 °C because soldering and welding
of stainless-steel wires are carried out in that temperature range.
The yield strength of the wire and, thus, the working range
necessary for a satisfactory orthodontic appliance are greatly
reduced after such annealing. However, using low-fusing solders

soldering is to use as little heat for as short a time as possible.
Other heating techniques include the use of a hydrogen-oxygen
torch, electric resistance heating, and indirect heating using a
brass wire intermediary.

CRITICAL QUESTIONS
Does welding of stainless-steel wires subject them to undesired annealing?
What can be done to reduce the effect of annealing?

Welding

CRITICAL QUESTION

Flat structures such as bands and brackets are usually joined by
spot welding, which produces a large electrical current that is
forced by the electrode to flow through a limited area (spot) on
the overlapped materials that are to be welded. The interfacial
resistance of the materials to the current flow produces intense
localized heating and fusion of the overlapped metals. No solder is
employed. Ideally, melting is confined to the junction area, and a
cast-type structure is formed. The grain structure of the surrounding wrought alloy should not be affected, but stress exists at the
interface of the cast and wrought structures, which would be the
most likely path of joint failure should fracture occur. The strength
of the welded joint decreases with an increase in the area of recrystallization of the adjacent wrought structure, and the joint strength
increases with the area of the weld. The welded joint is susceptible
to corrosion, primarily because of the loss of passivation caused by
sensitization and the localized stress at the interface between the
weld area and the surrounding wrought structure.

Which failure processes in soldered and welded joints in stainless-steel
orthodontic appliances might be observed clinically?

Cobalt-Chromium-Nickel Alloys

and minimizing the soldering and welding times can minimize
the softening. Any softening that occurs under such conditions
can be remedied considerably by contouring and polishing of
the soldered areas.
An increase in the elastic properties of a stainless-steel wire
can be obtained by heating it to temperatures between 400 °C
and 500 °C for 5 to 120 seconds after cold working. This
stress-relief heat treatment promotes the recovery annealing
stage, which removes the residual stresses introduced during
manipulation of the wire. Thus it stabilizes the shape of the
appliance. This is important clinically because such residual
stresses can promote fracture when the appliance is being
adjusted by the clinician.

Soldering and Welding Stainless Steel
Stainless-steel components are often joined by silver solders.
Although such solders corrode in use because they are anodic to
stainless steel, this is not objectionable in orthodontic appliances.
These appliances are temporary structures, usually not worn in the
mouth for more than 6 to 30 months, and frequent inspection by
the orthodontist is necessary. As discussed earlier, a fluoride-containing flux is used to dissolve the passivating surface film formed
by chromium.
Technical Considerations for Soldering

The freehand soldering of stainless steel is not greatly different
from that of gold soldering, described earlier. A needlelike, nonluminous, gas-air flame may be used to minimize annealing of
the metal surrounding the joint. The reducing zone of the flame
should be used. The soldering should be observed in a shadow,
against a black background, so that the temperature can be judged
by the color of the workpiece. The color should never exceed a
dull red.
Prior to soldering, the parts should be tack-welded for alignment during the soldering procedure. Then flux should be
applied, and the heavier-gauge part should be heated first. Flux
must cover all of the areas to be soldered before heat is applied. As
soon as the flux fuses, the solder alloy should be added, and heating is then continued until the solder flows around and within
the joint. After the solder has flowed, the work should be immediately removed from the heat source and quenched in water.
From the preceding discussion on the sensitization of austenitic
stainless steels, it should be evident that the objective during

Cobalt-chromium-nickel alloys were originally developed for use
as watch springs (Elgiloy) and first marketed for use in orthodontic appliances during the 1950s. Elgiloy has excellent resistance
to tarnish and corrosion in the oral environment, and it uses the
same welding and soldering procedures used for stainless-steel
wires.
The manufacturer offers Elgiloy wires in four different tempers:
soft, ductile, semiresilient, and resilient. The most widely used is
the soft temper (Blue Elgiloy), which is easily manipulated and
then heat-treated to achieve increased resilience; other tempers
are also responsive to heat treatment. The resulting changes in
mechanical properties are associated with precipitation reactions.
Clinicians can easily perform heat treatment using an electrical
resistance welding apparatus and a special paste provided by the
manufacturer to indicate the optimal period of time.
Because of their nearly identical values of elastic modulus
(Table 9-16), the orthodontic force delivery for Blue Elgiloy and
stainless-steel orthodontic wires is essentially the same. Heat treatment of Blue Elgiloy orthodontic wires was found to increase the
elastic modulus in tension from a range of 160 to 190 GPa for
as-received wires to a range of 180 to 210 GPa, along with the
springback (YS/E) increase from a range of 0.0045 to 0.0065 to a
range of 0.0054 to 0.0074. Co-Cr-Ni wire products are also available from other manufacturers, but minimal mechanical property
data have been reported in the literature.

Nickel-Titanium Alloys
A wrought nickel-titanium orthodontic wire alloy known as
Nitinol (now Nitinol Classic) was introduced commercially during the 1970s. This wire alloy is noted for its much lower elastic

CHAPTER 9

Mechanical Properties
The approximate mechanical properties of Nitinol wire are shown
in Table 9-16. The placement of permanent bends by the clinician
in Nitinol wires is difficult because of their high resilience. Nitinol has high ductility, and its ability to undergo substantial work
hardening is evident from the considerably higher tensile strength
relative to the yield strength. The very low elastic modulus of Nitinol results in very low forces delivered by the appliance compared
with similarly constructed and activated appliances from stainless
steel and Co-Cr-Ni alloys, and the springback or elastic range
available for tooth movement is much greater for Nitinol compared with these two alloys.

modulus (Table 9-16) and much wider elastic working range compared with the stainless-steel and Co-Cr-Ni wires. The alloy name
Nitinol originally came from the two elements, nickel (Ni) and
titanium (Ti), and the Naval Ordnance Laboratory (NOL) where
these alloys were developed.
The nickel-titanium alloys used in dentistry are based on the
equiatomic intermetallic compound NiTi, which contains 55%
nickel and 45% titanium by weight. Orthodontic wire alloys contain small amounts of other elements, such as copper and chromium. The microstructure consists predominantly of NiTi, but
other very small precipitates having different compositions are also
observed. The austenitic NiTi phase has a complex BCC structure,
and the martensitic NiTi phase has been reported to possess a distorted monoclinic, triclinic, or hexagonal structure. The names
austenitic and martensitic for these different crystallographic forms
of NiTi have been taken from the metallurgical terminology for
carbon steel and stainless steel.

Region c-d corresponds to permanent deformation during loading, and de corresponds to initial unloading of the permanently deformed arch wire.
Regions b-c and e-f correspond to the forward and reverse directions,
respectively, of the stress-induced transformation between the low-stress
austenitic and high-stress martensitic structures. The final stage of unloading occurs along region f-g.

CRITICAL QUESTION
What are the clinical advantages of a shape-memory nickel-titanium
orthodontic wire compared with a stainless-steel orthodontic wire?

Superelasticity and Shape Memory in Nickel-Titanium
Orthodontic Wires
Transformation between the austenitic and martensitic forms of
Nitinol alloys can be induced by both temperature and stress.
Austenitic NiTi is the high-temperature, low-stress form, and
martensitic NiTi is the low-temperature, high-stress form. Transformation between these phases occurs by a twinning process,
which is reversible below the elastic limit and also results in
changes in volume and electrical resistivity.
Figure 9-17 presents a highly schematic illustration of the
stress-strain behavior for a certain type of NiTi wire in bending;
the bending moment and the angular deflection are equivalent
to the stress-versus-strain relationship tested in tension. Segment
a-b corresponds to the initial elastic deformation of the wire,
followed by segment b-c, where the austenitic structure transforms to the martensitic structure. After the transformation is
completed at point c (typically at approximately 10% strain),
further elastic deformation and plastic deformation occur with
increasing bending moment along segment c-d. During unloading, this sequence of events is reversed, with segment d-e corresponding to loss of elastic strain (angular deflection) in the
martensitic structure, followed by transformation back to the
austenitic structure along segment e-f, and finally, loss of elastic
strain in the austenitic structure along segment f-g, as the bending moment decreases to zero. A small amount of permanent
angular deflection remains in the wire because of the permanent

deformation induced in segment c-d. This behavior in segments
b-c and e-f is called superelasticity or pseudoelasticity in engineering materials science. Segment e-f delivers a nearly constant force
for tooth movement during deactivation (unloading), which
does not occur with stainless-steel or Co-Cr-Ni wires. When the
superelastic wire is tested in tension, for which the stress and
strain are uniform over the cross section, segments b-c and e-f
are both horizontal (corresponding, respectively, to the stressassisted transformation from austenite to martensite on loading
and the reverse transformation on unloading). These two regions
are referred to as the upper superelastic plateau and the lower superelastic plateau, respectively. There has been some question about
whether the superelastic NiTi wires are activated sufficiently into
the superelastic region under clinical conditions to take advantage of this property.
Tooth movement can also be achieved by another property
of some NiTi wires. The shape of the appliance, such as an orthodontic arch wire, is first established when the alloy is heated at
a temperature near 480 °C to stabilize the austenitic structure
(Figure 9-18). When the appliance is cooled to room temperature,
the alloy converts to the twinned martensitic phase and retains its
shape. The appliance is then reshaped at room temperature by the
clinician; the deformed martensitic structure is altered because
of the stress induced by the deformation. When it is placed into
brackets bonded to malpositioned teeth, exposure of the wire to
body temperature will promote the deformed martensitic structure to revert back to the austenitic structure, and the appliance
regains its shape established near 480 °C, which allows for further
tooth movement. This phenomenon is called shape memory, which

• Figure 9-18 Shape-memory process. The austenite crystal is stable at a higher temperature and can
be plastically deformed to some desired shape without altering its crystalline structure. When austenite is
cooled to room temperature, it converts to a twinned martensite without undergoing a shape change. When
the twinned martensite is deformed plastically under a stress, the structure detwins and takes up a new
shape. Note that the overall shape of the object has changed, but the relative position between atoms did
not change. Upon heating to body temperature (for orthodontic wire), the deformed martensite (detwinned
martensite) will revert back to austenite and regain its original shape because there is no change in the relative
position of the atom arrangement. Heating of twinned martensite will also recover the austenite structure.

is possessed at body temperature by some commercial NiTi wire
products.
The temperature at which transformation from the martensitic structure to austenitic structure is completed is called the Af
(austenite-finish) temperature. This transformation temperature
can be varied by elemental additions, such as copper and chromium, which are used for the commercial copper Ni-Ti wires
to achieve different activation temperatures (27, 35, and 40 °C)
in the oral environment. The Af temperature is a clinically relevant property of an NiTi orthodontic wire, and its measurement
by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is included in ISO
Standard 15841 (ADA Specification No. 32) on wires for use in
orthodontics.
These standards subdivide orthodontic wires into type 1 and
type 2, which display linear elastic and nonlinear elastic behavior, respectively, during unloading from 50 °C. Stainless steel,
cobalt-chromium-nickel, and β-titanium wires are type 1; nickeltitanium wires are type 2. Mechanical properties can be measured
using the tension test or the three-point bending test, where the
bending force during unloading is measured at 3-, 2-, 1-, and 0.5mm deflections. Whereas type 1 wires can be tested at room temperature, type 2 wires are to be tested at 36 ± 1 °C.
As noted previously, nickel-titanium orthodontic wires are difficult to reconfigure into clinical shapes, and they must be joined
by mechanical crimps because the alloy can be neither soldered

nor welded. In addition, nickel-titanium orthodontic wires have
relatively rough surfaces, which result in high friction between
arch wires and brackets; this can potentially prolong the time
needed for clinical treatment.

CRITICAL QUESTIONS
What are the differences in the three general types of nickel-titanium
orthodontic wires? Why is the superelasticity property of some NiTi alloys
advantageous for endodontic applications?

Nickel-Titanium Endodontic Instruments
The outstanding property of the nickel-titanium alloy that
resulted in its widespread use for endodontics is its much lower
elastic modulus compared with the austenitic stainless steel that
was formerly used for hand instruments. This allows the rotating
NiTi file, used with an electric motor and reduction contra-angle
handpiece, to negotiate curved root canals with facility. Although
the pioneering article by Walia et al. investigated hand files fabricated from nonsuperelastic NiTi wire, subsequent NiTi alloys for
rotary instruments were designed by manufacturers to have superelastic character with transformable austenite. The superelastic
property enables the instrument to adapt along a sharply curving
root canal during instrumentation, and the small increase in stress

CHAPTER 9

developed at the canal wall minimizes the risk for perforation of
the canal. DSC studies have shown that the enthalpy change (ΔH)
for transformation between martensite to austenite in rotary NiTi
instruments is less than that for superelastic orthodontic wires,
indicating that transformable austenite comprises a smaller proportion of the NiTi microstructure.
The drawback of the NiTi alloy is that nickel-titanium rotary
endodontic instruments have generally been fabricated by
machining the starting wire blanks, in contrast to stainless-steel
endodontic instruments, for which a special apparatus twists the
tapered starting wire blank. However, rotary instruments have
recently been introduced in which the NiTi wire blank is twisted
(microstructure in the intermediate R-phase condition), rather
than being machined. The machining process results in substantial permanent deformation (Figure 9-19) at the edges of the cutting flutes and surface flaws that can lead to premature fracture of
the instrument. It is likely that the NiTi alloy is inherently notch
sensitive because the coexisting austenitic and martensitic NiTi
phases have very different crystal structures.
Recently, new NiTi alloys, beginning with M-wire, have
been introduced to endodontics, for which special manufacturer
thermomechanical processing yields a largely martensitic microstructure. Rotary instruments fabricated by special proprietary
protocols from these new alloys have improved fatigue resistance
and have become widely used in practice. The novel products
from one manufacturer are described as having the property of
controlled memory.

molybdenum stabilizes the BCC β-titanium structure at room
temperature and yields an alloy of lower elastic modulus and
higher ductility than those of the HCP α-titanium alloys. This
means that β-titanium can easily be drawn into wires for orthodontic applications, but careful manufacturing attention to the
drawing conditions is essential. Among all β-titanium orthodontic wires available, the original commercial alloy had the trade
name of titanium-molybdenum alloy (TMA). This orthodontic
alloy composition is very close to that of the engineering Beta
III titanium alloy.

Mechanical Properties of Beta-Titanium Wires
The elastic modulus of β-titanium wires is intermediate between
that for stainless-steel and Elgiloy wires and that for Nitinol wires
(Table 9-16). The springback (YS/E) for β-titanium wires is much
greater than that for the stainless-steel and Elgiloy wires and very
similar to that for the Nitinol wires. The β-titanium wires can be
highly cold-worked, and because of the BCC structure of the β
phase, the wires have high formability, which is comparable to
that of austenitic stainless steel, and can be readily bent into various orthodontic configurations.
Because of the high reactivity of titanium, careful control of
the original cast ingot quality, the atmosphere, and other processing parameters during wire drawing is essential. (This is also
true for manufacturing of the nickel-titanium orthodontic wires.)
Whereas heat treatments can be performed to alter the mechanical
properties of β-titanium wires, these wires should not be heattreated by the clinician.

The first commercial β-titanium orthodontic wires had an
approximate composition (by weight) of 79% titanium, 11%
molybdenum, 6% zirconium, and 4% tin. The addition of

Welding
Titanium alloys are highly reactive with oxygen at high temperature. Because of their high melting temperatures and this reactivity, soldering of these alloys with torches is not advisable. To
prevent the potential reaction of titanium alloys with the oxygen
in ambient air during the metal-joining process, these procedures
are often performed in a vacuum or an argon environment. The
β-titanium wires are the only orthodontic wire alloy type that
demonstrates true weldability, and clinically satisfactory joints
can be made by electrical resistance welding. Such joints need not

be reinforced with solder, which is necessary for welded joints in
stainless-steel and Elgiloy wires. A weld made with insufficient
heat will fail at the interface between the wires, whereas overheating may cause a failure adjacent to the joint. Figure 9-20 is a cross
section of a properly welded β-titanium joint, showing minimum
distortion of the original cold-worked structure.

Corrosion Resistance
Because of a passive TiO2 surface film, which is analogous to the
Cr2O3 film on stainless-steel and Elgiloy wires, titanium and its
alloys generally have excellent corrosion resistance and environmental stability. There has been some concern about the biocompatibility of orthodontic wires containing nickel, which may cause
localized tissue irritation or an allergic reaction in some patients,
and it should be noted that β-titanium is the only major orthodontic wire alloy that is nickel-free.
Surface Property
The surface roughness of the β-titanium wires is much greater
than that of the stainless-steel and Elgiloy wires. Scanning electron microscopy observations suggest that the surface roughness
originates from adherence of the titanium in the β-titanium alloys
to the dies or rollers used in the wire-manufacturing process. Special proprietary lubricants must be used by the manufacturers to
alleviate this problem. During orthodontic treatment, the rough
arch-wire surfaces increase sliding friction, and localized cold
welding of the arch-wire alloy to the metal bracket has also been
hypothesized.
Surface treatment of nickel-titanium and β-titanium orthodontic wires with nitrogen ion implantation has been performed
to decrease adhesion between wires and brackets. One study
reported significant differences for in vitro tooth movement with
ion-implanted TMA and nickel-titanium wires, compared with
their non–ion-implanted counterparts. However, the results of
a recent clinical study suggest that there were no significant differences for the rate of space closure when ion-implanted TMA,
conventional TMA (not ion-implanted), and stainless-steel wires
were used.

Additional Wrought Alloys
Noble-metal wires are still occasionally employed in the construction of RPD clasps and orthodontic appliances and in retention
pins for restorations and endodontic posts. The elastic modulus
of these gold alloy wires is approximately 100 to 120 GPa, which
is higher than that for titanium-based wrought alloys but considerably lower than those of stainless steel and Co-Cr-Ni wrought
alloys. Table 9-17 shows the compositions of two types of noblemetal wrought wires and the mechanical properties of two products: platinum-gold-palladium (P-G-P), which contains 40% to
50% platinum, 25% to 30% gold, and 25% to 30% palladium
by weight, and palladium-silver-copper (P-S-C), which consists of
42% to 44% palladium, 38% to 41% silver, 16% to 17% copper,
and 0% to 1% platinum by weight. The high fusion temperature
(hence high recrystallization temperature) of P-G-P wire would
be especially useful for casting an RPD framework to this alloy.
It is the high fusion temperatures of platinum and palladium that
raise the fusion temperature of P-G-P wire. P-S-C wires have also
been considered useful for dental applications because their fusion
temperatures are higher than those of the gold-based alloy wires.
Wrought cobalt-chromium alloys for RPD clasps are also
available. For example, a cobalt-chromium-tungsten-nickel wire
(Ticonium) has a yield strength of approximately 920 MPa, a
tensile strength of nearly 1400 MPa, and a percent elongation
of 19%. This wrought alloy is not heat-treatable and is designed
for use with the lower-fusing nickel-chromium-beryllium casting
alloy from the same manufacturer.
