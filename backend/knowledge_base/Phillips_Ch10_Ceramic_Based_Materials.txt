condition prior to final sintering.

202

Metal-ceramic prosthesis A partial crown, full crown, or fixed
partial denture made with a metal substructure to which porcelain is bonded for aesthetic enhancement via an intermediate metal oxide layer. The terms porcelain fused to metal (PFM),
porcelain bonded to metal (PBM), porcelain to metal (PTM), and
ceramometal are also used to describe these prostheses, but
metal-ceramic (MC) is the term accepted internationally.
Porcelain A relatively dense, white ceramic material produced by
sintering a mixture of feldspar, kaolin, quartz, and other substances, strictly referring to those containing kaolin.
Porcelain, feldspathic Ceramic composed of a glass matrix phase
and one or more crystalline phases, such as leucite (KAlSi2O6),
sanidine (KAlSi3O8), and apatite [Ca5(PO4)3(F, Cl, OH)]. Most commercial dental porcelains designed for metal-ceramic restorations are partially crystallized feldspathic glasses that consist
of tetragonal leucite (K2O•Al2O3•4SiO2) crystals in a glass-phase

Transformation toughening A ceramic-strengthening mechanism that occurs through transformation of crystalline structure.
For example, the stress-activated tetragonal (t) to monoclinic
(m) transformation in yttria-stabilized zirconia causes slight
volume expansion at the crack tip that keeps the crack from
propagating and raises the stress needed to keep the crack
propagation to fracture the prosthesis.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Which property best describes the fracture resistance of dental ceramics?

Dental ceramics consist of silicate glasses, porcelains, glassceramics, or highly crystalline solids. They are nonmetallic,
inorganic structures, primarily containing compounds of oxygen
with one or more metallic or semimetallic elements (aluminum,
boron, calcium, cerium, lithium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, silicon, sodium, titanium, and zirconium). Many dental
ceramics contain a crystal phase and a silicate glass matrix phase.
Silicate glasses differ from nonsilicate glasses in that silicon is the
central divalent cation that is bound to four relatively large oxygen anions that link in a random order to other tetrahedra to
form polymeric-type (SiO2)n chains. Their structures are characterized by chains of (SiO4)–4 tetrahedra in which Si4+ cations are
positioned at the center of each tetrahedron, with O– anions at
each of the four corners (Figure 10-1). The resulting structure is
not closely packed and exhibits both covalent and ionic bonds.
The SiO4 tetrahedra are linked together by sharing their corners
and not their edges or faces. They are arranged as linked chains
of tetrahedra, each of which contains two oxygen atoms for every
silicon atom. In industry, the term porcelain is generally associated
with ceramics produced with a significant amount of kaolinite
[Al2Si2O5(OH)4 or Al2O3•2SiO2•2H2O]. Kaolinite is a form of
kaolin, which is a type of clay. None of the modern low-fusing
or ultralow-fusing porcelains contains any clay product such as
kaolinite.

General Properties of Ceramic Materials
The properties of ceramics are customized for dental applications
by precisely controlling the types and amounts of the components
used in their production. Ceramics exhibit chemical, mechanical,
physical, and thermal properties that distinguish them from metals, acrylic resins, and resin-based composites. Most ceramics are
characterized by their biocompatibility, aesthetic potential, refractory nature, high hardness, low to moderate fracture toughness,

excellent wear resistance, susceptibility to tensile fracture, and
chemical inertness.

Chemical Properties
Chemical inertness is an important characteristic because this
ensures that the chemically stable surface of dental restorations
does not release potentially harmful elements and reduces the risk
of surface roughening with increased abrasiveness or increased
susceptibility to bacterial adhesion over time. The chemical inertness also makes ceramics more resistant to corrosion than plastics.
Ceramics do not react readily with most liquids, gases, alkalis,
and weak acids. They also remain relatively stable over long time
periods, although they have been shown to undergo corrosion in
simulated oral environments.
Acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF), one of the most commonly used fluoride gels for caries control, is known to etch glass
by selective leaching of sodium ions, thereby disrupting the silica
network. When glazed feldspathic porcelain is exposed to 1.23%
APF or 8% stannous fluoride, surface roughness is produced
within 4 minutes. As shown in Figure 10-2, a 30-minute exposure
to 1.23% APF gel resulted in preferential attack of the glass phase
(areas with white precipitate particles) of a body porcelain. However, the use of neutral gel, such as 0.4% stannous fluoride and
2% sodium fluoride, has no significant effect on the ceramic surface. Dentists should be aware of these long-term clinical effects
of fluorides on ceramic and composite restorations and avoid the
use of APF gels when composites and ceramics are present. APF
gels should not be used on glazed porcelain surfaces. If the use of
such a gel is needed, the surface of these restorations should be
protected with petroleum jelly, cocoa butter, or wax.

CRITICAL QUESTION
If tensile strength is not a reliable property of dental ceramics, which property
is a better measure of the material’s fracture resistance?

Mechanical Properties
Ceramics exhibit good to excellent strength and fracture toughness.
Zirconium dioxide is one of the strongest and toughest ceramics
and has a flexural strength similar to that of steel, but this material’s fracture toughness is much lower than that of steel. Although

ceramics are strong and heat-resistant, these materials are brittle
and may fracture without warning when flexed excessively or when
quickly heated and cooled (i.e., under thermal shock conditions).

Resistance to Tensile Fracture
The susceptibility to tensile fracture is a drawback, particularly
when flaws and tensile stress coexist in the same region of a ceramic
prosthesis. Strength is not an inherent property of ceramics
because this property varies with specimen size, specimen length,
specimen shape, loading rate, surface preparation methods, and
the environment. For example, the strength of silica-based ceramics increases with a decrease in specimen thickness, an increase in
stressing rate, and a smoother surface. Such variability indicates
that strength is not necessarily a bulk property because surface
conditions can significantly alter the mean strength and the spread
of experimental values, as indicated by the Weibull modulus and
the coefficient of variation (Chapter 4, Weibull Modulus). Therefore the tensile strength of ceramics is not a useful parameter to
describe the fracture resistance.
The general belief is that dental ceramics fail primarily because
of their brittle nature. From a fracture mechanics point of view,
the major reason for the fracture of ceramics is their low resistance
to crack growth. Two fracture-mechanics properties that better
explain this behavior are fracture toughness and critical strain
energy release rate. Fracture toughness, which is designated as
KIc, describes the critical stress intensity factor based on a Mode I
(see Figure 4-14, C) crack opening under tensile stress. For dental
ceramics, KIc varies from 0.8 MPa∙m1/2 for feldspathic porcelain to
8 MPa∙m1/2 or more for yttria-stabilized zirconia to 12 MPa∙m1/2
or more for ceria-stabilized alumina-zirconia ceramic. In comparison, KIc values are 0.7 to 1.3 MPa∙m1/2 for enamel, 3.1 MPa∙m1/2
for dentin, and 0.8 to 2.5 MPa∙m1/2 for resin composites.
The critical strain energy release rate, which is designated as GIc,
is a measure of the strain energy that is released per unit increase in
crack area as a ceramic with flaws or cracks is loaded progressively.
The subscript I refers to the crack-opening mode under tension as
expressed for KIc. Comparative values of KIc (MPa∙m1/2) versus GIc
(kJ/m2) for different types of materials are as follows: (1) ductile
metals, 150 versus 50 to 200; (2) brittle metals, 25 versus 1 to 5;
and (3) soda-lime glass, 0.8 versus 0.5.
Abrasiveness to Enamel
In spite of their overall excellence in meeting the ideal requirements
of a prosthetic material, dental ceramics can cause catastrophic wear
of opposing tooth structure under certain conditions because of
their hardness. Wear is a form of fracture that occurs microscopically on the surface. The most extreme damage occurs because of
bruxing, premature occlusal contacts, and/or inadequate occlusal
adjustments. When cuspid-guided disocclusion is ensured, the wear
of opposing enamel and dentin will be greatly reduced. The abrasive
wear of opposing tooth structure can be reduced further by periodically refinishing the occlusal surface after frequent exposures to
carbonated beverages and/or acidulated phosphate fluoride.
The microfracture is the dominant mechanism responsible for
the damage that a roughened ceramic surface can cause to tooth
enamel surfaces. Enamel is susceptible to this kind of microfracture (Figure 10-3) through four specific mechanisms: (1)
asperities extending from the ceramic surface that produce high
localized stresses and microfracture; (2) gouging that results from
high stresses and large hardness differences between two surfaces
or particles extending from these surfaces; (3) impact or erosion
that occurs through the action of abrasive particles carried in a

• Figure 10-3 Excessive wear of mandibular teeth that were abraded by
opposing porcelain surfaces. (Courtesy Dr. H. Young.)

flowing liquid, such as saliva; and (4) contact stress microfracture
that increases localized tensile stress and also enhances the damage
caused by asperities, gouging, and impact or erosion. Because of
microfracture mechanisms, polishing the ceramic surface periodically to reduce the height of asperities and to minimize enamel
wear rates is necessary and highly recommended.
The abrasiveness of ceramics against enamel is affected by
numerous factors and properties of the crystal-phase particles
and the glass matrix (if present). These include ceramic properties such as hardness, tensile strength, fracture toughness, fatigue
resistance, particle–glass bonding, particle–glass interface integrity, and chemical durability. The oral environment also affects the
abrasiveness, such as frequency of exposure to corrosive chemical
agents (acidulated phosphate fluoride, carbonated beverages), abrasiveness of foods, residual stress, subsurface quality (voids or other
imperfections), magnitude and orientation of applied forces, chewing patterns, bruxing frequency, contact area, lubrication by saliva,
and duration of exposure to abrasive particles. All of these factors
can lead to wear of the ceramic, with the production of roughened
surfaces that can in turn abrade the opposing enamel. As a general
rule, the larger the hardness difference between two sliding surfaces, the greater the degree of wear. However, this simple principle
does not explain the wide variation in wear rates that is exhibited
by different patients under apparently similar conditions.

CRITICAL QUESTION
How can the potential abrasive damage of tooth enamel that opposes
ceramic surfaces be minimized?

Biological Properties
By virtue of their chemical inertness and resistance to corrosion,
ceramics are very biocompatible restorative materials because they
do not release any harmful agents to the oral environment. There
have been reports of traces of lead in feldspathic-based ceramic
powders up to 250 ppm. The presence of lead stems from the
use of the natural mineral feldspar in the ceramic. The American
Dental Association (ADA) Specification 69 states that the maximum allowable concentration of lead in dental ceramic powder
is 300 ppm. The main issue is not the total amount of lead in

CHAPTER 10

the powder but the leaching potential of lead or solubility of the
ceramic restoration in the oral cavity. International Organization
for Standardization (ISO 6872) has established a solubility testing
standard for dental ceramics but no specific values for the maximum allowable release of lead. Solubility testing standards are considered harsher than the conditions in the oral environment and
are representative of a lifetime of use. The amount of lead released
after exposure to 4% acetic acid at 80 °C for 16 hours was not
detectable according to several independent studies. The limits of
detection (LOD) established for these studies were at 5 and 10 ppb
(μg/L), at which no lead was detected. If lead was indeed released,
the level was below the 5 ppb level and is considered insignificant.

Physical Properties
Two other important attributes of dental ceramics are their potential for matching the appearance of natural teeth and their low
electrical and thermal conductivities.

Color-Matching Ability and Aesthetic Qualities
Dental ceramics are excellent in matching the appearance of natural teeth because they can display translucency, color, and chroma.
Color phenomena and terminology are discussed in Chapter 3,
Color and Optical Effects. Perfect color matching is extremely difficult and demands exceptional skill and experience on the part of
the dentist and lab technician. The structure of the tooth influences
its color. Dentin is opaquer than enamel and reflects light very well.
Enamel represents a predominantly crystalline layer over the dentin
and is composed of tiny prisms or rods cemented together by an
organic substance. The indices of refraction of the rods and the
cementing substance are different. As a result, light rays are dispersed by varying proportions of absorption, transmission, scattering, and reflection to produce a resulting translucent effect and
a sensation of depth as the scattered light ray reaches the eye. As
light strikes the tooth surface, part of the light is reflected, and the
remainder penetrates the enamel and is scattered. Any light reaching the dentin is either absorbed or partially reflected to the eye and
partially scattered within the enamel. If dentin is not present, as in
the tip of an incisor, some of the light rays may be transmitted into
the oral cavity. As a result, this area may appear to be more translucent than that toward the gingival area. Because the law of energy
conservation must apply, the following relationship shows the five
energy components that are derived from the energy (E) of the incident light: Eincident = Escattered + Ereflected + Eabsorbed + Etransmitted + Efluoresced.
Although some of the absorbed light may be converted into
heat, some may be transmitted back to the eye as fluorescent energy.
Light rays can also be dispersed, giving a color or shade that varies
in different teeth. The dispersion can vary with the wavelength of
the light. Therefore the appearance of the teeth may vary according
to whether they are viewed in direct sunlight, reflected daylight,
tungsten light, or fluorescent light. This phenomenon is called
metamerism. The dentist and laboratory technician must reproduce
the aesthetic characteristics sufficiently such that the appearance of
a ceramic prosthesis is discernable only to the trained eye.
Specimens of ceramic shades are produced and distributed in
a specific order in shade guides by dental ceramic manufacturers
to assist dentists and lab technicians in selecting optimum ceramic
shades and for communicating the desired prosthesis appearance
to each other. Shade guides made of porcelain are used most often
by dentists to describe the desired appearance of a natural tooth or
ceramic prosthesis. However, there are several deficiencies of shade
guides. Shade-guide tabs are much thicker than the thickness of

ceramic that is used for dental crowns or veneers, and they are
more translucent than teeth and ceramic crowns that are backed
by a nontranslucent dentin substructure, veneering ceramics that
are backed by an opaque core ceramic, or a metal framework.
Much of the incident light is transmitted through a tab. In contrast, most of the incident light on a crown is reflected except at
the incisal edge and at proximal incisal areas. Furthermore, the
necks of shade tabs are made from a deeper hue, and this region
tends to distract the matching ability of the observer in the gingival third of the tab. To avoid this situation, some clinicians grind
away the neck area of a set of shade tabs.
The production of color sensation with a pigment is a physically
different phenomenon from that obtained by optical reflection,
refraction, and dispersion. The color of a pigment is determined by
selective absorption and selective reflection. For example, if white
light is reflected from a red surface, all the light with a wavelength different from that of red is absorbed, and only the red light is reflected.
If a red hue is present in a ceramic crown, but the red hue of the same
wavelength is not present in the light beam, the tooth will appear as
a different shade. If the tooth or restoration surface is rough, most
of the light will be scattered, and little will penetrate the structure.

Conductivity
Ceramics also offer freedom from galvanic effects (low electrical conductivity). Because the metal atoms transfer their outermost electrons to the nonmetallic atoms and stabilize their highly
mobile electrons, ceramics are also excellent thermal (low thermal
conductivity and low thermal diffusivity) and electrical insulators.
Thus tooth sensitivity associated with metallic restorations that are
electrical and thermal conductors is minimized.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Which two inventions dramatically increased the success and survival
probability of metal-ceramic (MC) restorations?

History of Dental Ceramics
The first porcelain tooth material was patented in 1789 by de
Chemant, a French dentist, and Duchateau, a French pharmacist.
This product was an improved version of “mineral paste teeth”
but was not used to produce individual teeth because there was
no effective way to attach the teeth to a denture base material. In
1808, Fonzi, an Italian dentist, invented a “terrometallic” porcelain tooth that was held in place by a platinum pin or frame. Planteau, a French dentist, introduced porcelain teeth to the United
States in 1817, and Peale, an artist, developed a baking process in
Philadelphia for these teeth in 1822. Commercial production of
these teeth began in 1825 by Stockton. In England, Ash developed
an improved version of the porcelain tooth in 1837. In 1844, the
nephew of Stockton founded the S.S. White Company, which led
to further refinement of the design and the mass production of
porcelain denture teeth.
Dr. Charles Land, the grandfather of aviator Charles Lindbergh, introduced one of the first ceramic crowns to dentistry
in 1903 using a platinum foil matrix (also known as coping) and
high-fusing feldspathic porcelain. These crowns exhibited excellent aesthetics, but the low flexural strength of porcelain resulted
in a high incidence of fractures. Although feldspathic porcelains
with reliable chemical bonding have been used in MC prostheses,
they were considered to be too weak to use reliably in the construction of all-ceramic crowns without a tougher ceramic core,

206

a cast-metal core, or metal-foil coping. Furthermore, their firing
shrinkage resulted in significant discrepancies in fit and adaptation of margins unless correction firings were performed.
In 1959, Weinstein et al. filed U.S. Patent 3,052,982, which
described formulations of feldspathic porcelains with a wide range
of expansion coefficients that also bonded chemically to and were
thermally compatible with the existing alloys of the time. The first
commercial porcelain was developed by VITA Zahnfabrik around
1963. Although the first VITA porcelain products were known for
their aesthetic properties, the subsequent introduction of the more
versatile Ceramco porcelain (Dentsply Sirona) exhibited thermalexpansion behavior that allowed this porcelain to be used safely
with a wider variety of alloys. Significant developments in the
areas of MC properties, design, and performance, such as opalescence, specialized internal staining techniques, greening-resistant
porcelains, porcelain butt-joint margins, and shoulder porcelains,
have significantly enhanced the overall appearance and “vitality”
of MC crowns and bridges and the clinical survivability of these
restorations.
McLean and Hughes in 1965 introduced fracture-resistant allporcelain crowns made of dental aluminous core ceramic, a glass
matrix containing 40 to 50 wt% Al2O3 fillers. A feldspathic porcelain veneer was required to achieve acceptable aesthetics because
of the chalky-white appearance of the aluminous porcelain core
material. A 5-year fracture rate report showed only 2% for anterior crowns but an unacceptable 15% when aluminous porcelain
was used for molar crowns. Relatively large sintering shrinkage
(about 15% to 20%) of the core material and the use of a 20- to
25-μm-thick platinum foil have made marginal adaptation difficult to achieve except by highly skilled laboratory technicians. The
principal indication for the use of aluminous porcelain crowns is
the restoration of maxillary anterior crowns when aesthetics is of
paramount importance.
Since the introduction of aluminous porcelain crowns and
methods to produce durable MC crowns in the 1960s, improvements in the composition of ceramics and the method of forming
all-ceramic crowns have greatly enhanced the ability to produce
more accurate-fitting and fracture-resistant crowns made entirely
of ceramic material. An all-ceramic system developed by controlling the crystallization of a glass (Dicor) was demonstrated
by Adair and Grossman in 1984 and, later, a machinable glassceramic version (Dicor MGC), which had a tetrasilicic fluormica
crystal volume of approximately 70%. In the early 1990s, a pressable glass-ceramic (IPS Empress), which contained approximately
34 vol% leucite, was introduced. A more fracture resistant, pressable glass-ceramic (IPS Empress 2) containing approximately
70 vol% of lithia disilicate crystals was introduced in the late
1990s. This core ceramic has been used for three-unit fixed dental
prostheses (FDPs) as far posterior as the second premolar. Other
systems based on Al2O3 and zirconia will be discussed later. Significant progress has been made toward the goal of developing less
abrasive veneering ceramics.
In the succeeding sections, the discussion will focus on MC
systems, all-ceramic systems, ceramic-strengthening mechanisms,
and indications for the use of ceramic materials in greater detail.

Metal-Ceramic Systems
Several clinical studies have confirmed the high overall survival
percentages of MC prostheses. In this chapter, the term metalceramic or MC is used synonymously with porcelain fused to metal
(PFM), although the former term is the most internationally

• Figure 10-4 Schematic illustration of a metal-ceramic (porcelain fused
to metal) crown that has a facial metal thickness of 0.3 to 0.5 mm. It is

accepted descriptor for these types of prosthetic material systems.
One clinical study revealed that the fracture rate of MC crowns
and bridges made from a high noble alloy was as low as 2.3% after
7.5 years. The most outstanding advantage of MC restorations is
their resistance to fracture. With metal occlusal surfaces, the fracture rate in posterior sites could be reduced further. Depending
on the ceramic material used, another potential advantage of MC
over all-ceramic restorations is that less tooth structure needs to
be removed to provide the proper bulk for the crown, especially if
metal alone is used on occlusal and lingual surfaces and porcelain
butt-joint margins are used on facial and buccal surfaces. Such
designs also cause less wear of antagonist enamel than occurs when
enamel is opposed by a ceramic surface.
A dark line at the facial margin of an MC crown that is associated
with a metal collar or metal margin is of significant concern when
gingival recession occurs. This adverse aesthetic result can be minimized by designing the crown with a ceramic margin or by using a
very thin knife-edge margin of metal that is veneered with opaque
shoulder porcelain (Figure 10-4). This ceramic margin should be
polished and/or glazed to avoid a rough surface at the margin.
One of the most frequently mentioned disadvantages is the
potential for metal allergy. Such allergic reactions are very rare,
except, possibly, when nickel-based alloys are used. Nonetheless,
MC crowns are decreasing in popularity for use in anterior restorations. An improvement in the properties of all-ceramic crowns
offers a greater potential for success in matching the appearance of
the adjacent natural tooth, especially when a relatively high degree
of translucency is desired. Indications may vary by patients, dentist preference, occlusion, and so forth. MC crowns are more commonly used for multiunit or posterior FDPs.
The following section focuses on the categories of ceramics,
requirements of metal components, bonding of ceramic to metal,
and fabrication of MC prostheses.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Which components of ceramics can cause excessive wear of tooth enamel?

CHAPTER 10

• Figure 10-5 Principal phase fields of feldspathic ceramics in the ternary
K2O-Al2O3-SiO2 system.

Ceramic Types
Conventional dental porcelain is a vitreous ceramic based on a
silica (SiO2) network and potash feldspar (K2O•Al2O3•6SiO2) or
soda feldspar (Na2O•Al2O3•6SiO2) or both. The ternary-phase
diagram in Figure 10-5 for the K2O-Al2O3-SiO2 system shows the
approximate composition ranges of feldspathic porcelain products that are used for MC prostheses and for denture teeth. The
feldspars used for dental porcelains are relatively pure and colorless. Thus pigments must be added to produce the hues of natural
teeth or the color appearance of tooth-colored restorative materials that may exist in adjacent teeth. Opacifiers and glass modifiers
to control the fusion temperature, sintering temperature, coefficient of thermal contraction, and solubility are also added. These
ingredients are mixed together and fired to a molten state to complete the necessary chemical reaction (fusing), and then quenched
in water. The resultant product, which is called frit, is then ground
to fine powders for application.

Feldspathic Porcelains
Feldspathic porcelains contain a variety of oxides including an
SiO2 matrix (52 to 65 wt%), Al2O3 (11 to 20 wt%), K2O (10 to
15 wt%), Na2O (4 to 15 wt%), and certain additives (e.g., B2O3,
CeO2, Li2O, TiO2, and Y2O3). These ceramics are called porcelains because they contain a glass matrix and one or more crystal
phases, although the term porcelain traditionally refers to products that were produced from kaolinite (Al2O3•2SiO2•2H2O),
which is a type of clay. The compositions of the veneering (layering) ceramics used for MC restorations (Table 10-1) generally
correspond to those used previously for veneering aluminous porcelain core ceramic (see History of Dental Ceramics section). For
MC porcelains, specific concentrations of soda, potash, and/or
leucite are necessary to reduce the sintering temperature and raise
the thermal expansion coefficient to a level compatible with that
of the metal coping. The opaque porcelains also contain relatively
large amounts of metallic oxide opacifiers to conceal the underlying metal and minimize the thickness of the opaque layer.
Feldspar has the tendency to form crystalline leucite
(K2O•Al2O3•4SiO2) when melted. Leucite is a potassium-aluminum-silicate mineral with a high coefficient of thermal expansion
(20 to 25 × 10–6/K) compared with that of feldspar porcelain

Ceramic-Based Materials

207

(8.6 × 10–6/K). When feldspar is heated at temperatures between
1150 °C and 1530 °C, this material undergoes incongruent melting to form leucite crystals in a liquid glass. Incongruent melting
is the process by which one material melts to form a liquid plus
a different crystalline material. The formation of leucite during
melting controls the thermal expansion of the porcelain during
bonding to a metal coping. Leucite has been added in felspar porcelains to control their coefficients of thermal contraction.
Feldspathic porcelains cannot be classified as glass-ceramics
because crystal formation does not occur through controlled
nucleation, crystal formation, and growth. There are four types of
feldspathic porcelains: (1) ultralow- and low-fusing ceramics, (2)
low-fusing specialty ceramics (shoulder porcelains and wash-coat
ceramics), (3) ceramic stains, and (4) ceramic glazes (autoglaze
and add-on glaze).
The particle type and size of crystal fillers greatly influence the
potential abrasiveness of the ceramic prosthesis. Thus the abrasiveness of the finished surface will depend on the presence or
absence of crystalline fillers. When the opaque porcelain of MC
restorations becomes exposed as a result of the loss of veneer, the
excessive wear of enamel may occur by direct two-body contact
with the opaque porcelain. When one examines the research literature investigating the potential for abrasive damage of enamel,
emphasis should be placed on clinical studies that clearly describe
the preparation history of the outer surface layer.
Veneering ceramics (“porcelains”) for metals have higher
expansion and contraction coefficients than the ceramics used
to veneer alumina or zirconia core ceramics. They should not be
subjected to nonessential repeated firings because this may lead
to devitrification and an increased risk of cloudiness within the
porcelain, in addition to potential changes in coefficient of thermal expansion (αe) and coefficient of thermal contraction (αc).
A proper matching of these thermal properties of the alloy and
porcelain is imperative to reduce the risk for chipping or cracking
of the ceramic veneers, either during cooling from the sintering or
glazing temperatures or at some later time in clinical service.

Ultralow-Fusing Ceramics for Metal-Ceramic Prostheses
In 1992, Duceram LFC (low-fusing ceramic; Dentsply Sirona) was
marketed as an ultralow-fusing ceramic for metal-ceramic prostheses with three unique features: (1) this ceramic is based on a hydrothermal glass in which water is incorporated into the silicate glass
structure to produce nonbridging hydroxyl groups that disrupt the
glass network, thereby decreasing the glass transition temperature,
viscosity, and firing temperature and increasing the coefficient of
thermal expansion (CTE) to allow use as a veneer for certain lowexpansion metals; (2) these types of ceramics are also claimed to be
“self-healing” through a process of forming a 1-μm-thick hydrothermal layer along the ceramic surface; and (3) the extremely small size
of the crystal particles (400 to 500 nm) enhances the opalescence
of the ceramic by reflecting blue light hues from the surface and
yellow hues from the interior of the ceramic. Other ultralow-fusing
ceramics (sintering temperatures below 850 °C) that are now commonly referred to as low-fusing ceramics have been introduced with
veneering glasses that are claimed to be kinder to opposing tooth
enamel, either because they are predominantly a glass phase material or because they contain very small crystal particles.
Most of the ultralow-fusing ceramics have microstructures that
exhibit either a well-distributed dispersion of small crystal particles
or few to no crystals. Wear studies are promising in several cases relative to the enamel wear caused by these ceramics, although not all
ultralow-fusing ceramics exhibit this decreased level of abrasiveness.

Ultralow-fusing ceramics contain less Al2O3 and increased concentrations of CaO, K2O, Li2O, and Na2O (Table 10-1).
Ultralow-fusing dentin and enamel ceramics may be easier to
polish and may yield smoother and less abrasive surfaces than conventional low-fusing and medium-fusing porcelains. Because of
their lower concentration of leucite crystals compared with conventional porcelains, they have lower expansion and contraction
coefficients. Their lower sintering temperatures provide opportunities for use with alloys that have lower fusion temperatures, like
Type 2 and 4 gold alloys, whose compositions must be modified
to ensure proper chemical bonding and matched thermal expansion and contraction coefficients.

Glass Modifiers
The sintering temperature of crystalline silica is too high for use
in veneering aesthetic layers onto dental casting alloys. At such
temperatures, the alloys would melt. In addition, the coefficient of
thermal contraction of crystalline silica is too low for these alloys.
Bonds between silica tetrahedra can be broken by the addition of
alkali metal ions such as sodium, potassium, and calcium. These
ions are associated with the oxygen atoms at the corners of the
tetrahedra and interruption of oxygen-silicon bonds. As a result,
the three-dimensional (3-D) silica network contains many linear
chains of silica tetrahedra that are able to move more easily at

lower temperatures than the atoms that are locked into the 3-D
structure of silica tetrahedra. This ease of movement is responsible
for the increased fluidity (decreased viscosity), lower softening
temperature, and increased thermal expansion conferred by glass
modifiers. However, too high of a modifier concentration reduces
the chemical durability (resistance to attack by water, acids, and
alkalis) of the glass. In addition, if too many tetrahedra are disrupted, the glass may crystallize (devitrify) during porcelain-firing
operations. Hence, a balance between a suitable melting range and
good chemical durability must be maintained.
Boric oxide (B2O3) can behave as a glass modifier to decrease viscosity, lower the softening temperature, and form a glass network.
Because boric oxide forms a separate lattice interspersed with the
silica lattice, this oxide still interrupts the more rigid silica network
and lowers the softening point of the glass. Water, which is not an
intentional addition to dental porcelain, can become a modifier.
The hydronium ion, H3O+, can replace sodium or other metal ions
in a ceramic that contains glass modifiers. This fact accounts for the
phenomenon of “slow crack growth” of ceramics that are exposed
to tensile stresses and moist environments. Water also may account
for the occasional long-term failure of porcelain restorations after
several years of service. The role of alumina (Al2O3) in glass formation is complex. Alumina is not a true glass former but can take
part in the glass network to alter the softening point and viscosity.

Manufacturers employ glass modifiers to produce dental porcelains with varying firing temperatures. Dental porcelains are
classified according to their firing temperatures. A typical classification is given in Table 10-2. The medium-fusing and high-fusing
types are used for the production of denture teeth. The low-fusing
and ultralow-fusing porcelains are used as veneering ceramics for
crown and bridge construction. Some of the ultralow-fusing porcelains are used for titanium and titanium alloys because of their
low-contraction coefficients that closely match those of the metals,
and because the low firing temperatures reduce the risk for growth
of the metal oxide. However, some of these ultralow-fusing porcelains contain enough leucite to raise their coefficients of thermal
contraction as high as those of conventional low-fusing porcelains.

Glazes and Stain Ceramics
To ensure adequate chemical durability, a self-glaze of porcelain is
preferred to an add-on glaze. A thin external layer of glassy material is formed during a firing procedure at a temperature and time
that cause localized softening of the glass phase. The add-on glaze
slurry material that is applied to the porcelain surface contains
more glass modifiers and thus has a lower firing temperature. Keep
in mind that higher proportions of glass modifier tend to reduce
the resistance of the applied glazes to leaching by oral fluids.

CRITICAL QUESTION
How is the degree of sintering controlled, and what parameter defines
complete sintering?

The aesthetics of porcelains for MC and ceramic prostheses,
veneers, and denture teeth may be enhanced through the application of stains and glazes to provide a more lifelike appearance. Stains
are simply tinted glazes that are also subject to the same chemical
durability problems. However, most of the currently available glazes
appear to have adequate durability if they are produced in thicknesses of 50 μm or more. To make shaded veneering ceramic to
simulate stain on natural teeth, coloring pigments are first fused
with feldspar, ground to fine powder, and then blended with the
unpigmented powdered frit to provide the proper hue and chroma.
Examples of metallic oxides and their respective color contributions
to porcelain include iron or nickel oxide (brown), copper oxide
(green), titanium oxide (yellowish brown), manganese oxide (lavender), and cobalt oxide (blue). Opacity may be achieved by the addition of cerium oxide, zirconium oxide, titanium oxide, or tin oxide.

• Figure 10-6 Autoglazed veneer ceramic.
One method for ensuring that the applied characterizing stains
will be permanent is to use them internally. Internal staining and
characterization can produce a lifelike result, particularly when
simulated enamel craze lines and other features are built into the
porcelain rather than merely applied to the surface. The disadvantage of internal staining and characterization is that the porcelain must be stripped completely if the color or characterization
is unacceptable.
Autoglazed feldspathic porcelain is stronger than unglazed porcelain. The glaze is effective in sealing surface flaws and reducing
stress concentrations. Figure 10-6 shows an MC crown with a properly fired autoglazed porcelain surface. If the glaze is removed by
grinding, the transverse strength may be only half that of the sample
with the glaze layer intact. However, the results of recent studies
indicate that porcelains with highly polished surfaces have strengths
comparable to those of specimens that were polished and glazed.
This observation is of clinical importance. After the porcelain restoration is cemented in the mouth, the common practice for the dentist is to adjust the occlusion by grinding the surface of the porcelain
with a diamond bur. This procedure weakens the porcelain, with a
roughened surface that can cause increased wear of enamel. There
are commercial finishing and polishing kits available for various
types of ceramics (Chapter 16, Ceramic Restorations). A smoother
surface also reduces the abrasion-causing damage to opposing teeth
or restorations.
Glazing of feldspathic porcelain is believed to eliminate surface flaws and produce a smoother surface. However, an optimum
method of producing the smoothest surface in the shortest time has
not been established. Fine polishing of a roughened surface, followed
by glazing will logically produce a smoother surface than polishing
alone, sandblasting, followed by glazing, or diamond grinding, followed by glazing. However, even though one polishes and/or glazes
a porcelain veneer surface, the surface will either slowly or markedly
break down in the presence of liquids in our everyday diets, including acids such as citric acid and acetic acid. Studies have shown that
these veneers will corrode over time with constant exposure to fluctuations in dietary pH changes coupled with occlusal wear.

Requirements of Metal Component
Many alloys are available to be veneered with low-fusing and
ultralow-fusing porcelains. The compositions of alloys control the castability, bonding ability to porcelain, and the magnitude of stresses that develop in the porcelains during cooling
from the sintering temperature. A list of typical alloy types sold
by one manufacturer is presented in Table 10-3, along with the

relevant properties of the respective alloy. The reader is referred to
Chapter 9, Requirements of Alloys for Metal-Ceramic Applications, for a description of other systems and the effects and purposes of the constituent metals.
The metal should have a higher melting range, with solidus
temperature greater than the sintering temperature of the ceramic
to prevent sag, creep (see Figure 9-2), or melting of the coping
or framework during sintering and/or glazing. This deformation
does not occur at oral temperatures. In addition, for gold alloys,
a small amount (about 1%) of base-metal elements, such as iron,
indium, and tin, is added to form a surface oxide layer during the
so-called “degassing” treatment. Degassing is a misnomer because
the primary purpose is to produce an adherent metal oxide on
the surface to facilitate bonding to porcelain. Other properties of
alloys of particular importance are the elastic modulus and proof
strength (yield strength), which should be high enough to resist
deformation, and the CTE should be closely matched to those
of the ceramics. These properties, along with the oxide layer, are
discussed in the following section.

CRITICAL QUESTION
What three conditions control the durability of ceramic bonding to an oxidized
metal coping?

Bonding Porcelain to Metal
A durable bond between the ceramic and the metal is the primary requirement for the success of an MC restoration. When the
ceramic powder is brought to sintering temperature, it melts and
wets the metal surfaces. The liquid-phase ceramic then fills the surface roughness of the metal coping. Meanwhile, the liquid-glass
phase reacts with metal oxide and forms an intermediate layer that
adheres strongly to the ceramic and the metal coping. When the
sintered MC prothesis is cooled to room temperature, the bond
between the metal and the ceramic may remain intact or become
separated, depending on the extent of difference between their
CTEs. These phenomena, occurring during the sintering and cooling cycle, constitute the three factors that control the durability
of MC bonding: mechanical interlocking, chemical bonding, and
thermal compatibility.
Recall from the discussion in Chapters 2 (Mechanical Interlocking) and 6 (Mechanisms of Adhesion) that mechanical interlocking
occurs when there is surface roughness. There is some evidence to
support MC bonding through a mechanical interlocking mechanism. One Pd-Ag alloy was found to form metal nodules on the
surface via a creep mechanism. These nodules presumably provide
sufficient mechanical retention for clinical use because this alloy had
been used for many years without noted problems (see Figure 9-3).

CRITICAL QUESTION
What condition is required of cast metals to achieve ionic and/or covalent
bonding to veneering porcelain?

As described, metal oxides work like coupling agents in bonding ceramic to metal. The oxidation behavior of these alloys largely
determines their potential for bonding with porcelain. Research
into the nature of MC adherence has indicated that those alloys
that form adherent oxides during the oxidation cycle also form a
good bond to porcelain, whereas those alloys with poorly adherent
oxides or poor bond of porcelain to the oxide (Figure 10-7) form

Ceramic-Based Materials

211

• Figure 10-7 Bond failure of metal-ceramic post and core prosthesis
poor wetting. Although the thickness of the oxide is thought to
play a role, there is insufficient evidence to support this theory.
Rather, the quality of the oxide and this oxide’s adhesion to the
metal substrate appear to be the most important factors. This porcelain–metal bond is primarily ionic but is likely to have a covalent character as well and is capable of forming on smooth surfaces
where little opportunity exists for mechanical interlocking.
There is a slight difference in the CTE between the metal and
ceramic; usually metal has a higher value than that of the ceramic.
During cooling to room temperature, the dimension of the metal
coping becomes smaller relative to the ceramic, and vice versa.
This means that some adjustment in the dimension at the interface must occur to keep both metal and ceramic bonded together
as they cool down. The metal coping needs to be stretched somehow, and the ceramic needs to be compressed. A possible scenario
is that the ceramic stretches the metal coping as the metal coping
compresses the ceramic. That arrangement results in stresses developed around the interface. For example, a difference in the coefficients of thermal contraction of 1.7 × 10–6/K can produce a shear
stress of 280 MPa in porcelain next to the MC interface when
the porcelain is cooled from 954 °C to room temperature. If the
shear resistance to failure is far less than 280 MPa, these stresses,
resulting from thermal contraction, would likely cause spontaneous bond failure or cracking of the veneering ceramic.
The tensile stresses induced within the restoration by occlusal
forces would be added to the residual thermal stresses. However,
for MC systems that have an average contraction coefficient difference of 0.5 × 10–6/K or less (between 600 °C and room temperature), fracture is unlikely to occur except in cases of extreme stress
concentration or extremely high intraoral forces. These are known
as thermally compatible systems. Many restorations made from metal
and porcelain combinations having contraction coefficient differences between 0.5 and 1.0 × 10–6/K are known to survive for many
years. Most patients generate typical bite forces of 400 to 800 N
between molar teeth and much lower forces between premolars
and between anterior teeth. Thus a rather small number of patients
will have bite force capabilities that are likely to cause fracture of
MC crowns or bridges even when residual thermal incompatibility
stresses are present. As a general rule, lower forces are generated by
younger children, female patients, a more closed bite, occlusion
between natural teeth, a denture, and fixed partial dentures.
The general term compatibility has been used in ISO 96931:2012 Dentistry—Compatibility Testing—Part 1: MC systems,
which describe a debonding/crack-initiation strength test, to identify the ability of the MC system to demonstrate both acceptable

212

adhesion of ceramic to metal oxide and freedom from the crack
formation associated with stresses caused by thermal expansion
and contraction differences.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Why should the difference in CTEs between metal coping and respective
veneering ceramic be small?

Other equally important properties of MC systems are the proportional limit (or yield strength) and elastic modulus of the metal
coping. Alloys with a high modulus will also reduce the stress distribution to the ceramic from occlusion. A high proportional limit
also prevents the metal coping from deforming plastically.
Various tests have been advocated for measuring the bond
strength; however, the strength values obtained may not represent
the true strength of the bond. Depending on the difference in
CTEs of the metal and the ceramic, residual stress evolves during
cooling. If a residual compressive stress evolves in the porcelain
adjacent to the interfacial region, a higher bond-strength value
will result, assuming that a valid test is used to produce interfacial
fracture. A fracture that initiates away from the interface does not
necessarily prove that the interfacial bond strength is greater than
the cohesive strength of either the metal or the ceramic. This fracture may merely be caused by misalignment of loading or unintended stress distributions such that the maximum tensile or shear
stresses do not occur in the interfacial region, or it may result from
surface flaws that favor separation away from the interface.
For an MC bond to be maintained over time, there should be
minimal residual shear stresses at the porcelain after cooling from
the sintering temperature. An unfavorable stress distribution during
the cooling process can result in immediate or delayed fracture of the
porcelain. Thus for a successful MC restoration to be realized, both a
strong interfacial bond and thermal compatibility are required.

Fabrication of Metal-Ceramic Prostheses
The fabrication of MC prostheses involves a two-step process: fabrication of the metal substructure and firing of veneering ceramic.
The metal substructures are constructed using the lost wax technique, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing
(CAD-CAM), or 3-D printing, which is followed by finishing,
polishing, and oxidation to achieve a surface oxide layer. The
application of the ceramic veneer can be achieved through manual
condensation or by vacuum pressing ceramic ingots.

Manual Porcelain Condensation
Ceramic for veneering MC prostheses, as well as for other applications, is supplied as a fine powder that is designed to be mixed
with water or another vehicle and condensed into the desired
form. The powder particles are of a particular size distribution
to produce the most densely packed porcelain when properly
condensed. Proper and thorough condensation is also crucial in
obtaining dense packing of the powder particles. Dense packing
lowers firing shrinkage and reduces porosity in the fired ceramic.
This condensation may be achieved by various methods, including
the vibration, spatulation, and brush techniques.
Firing Procedure
The thermochemical reactions between components of the
ceramic are virtually completed during the original manufacturing process of making frits. Thus the purpose of firing is to sinter

the ceramic particles together for a specific time and temperature
combination to form the prosthesis. For low-fusing porcelain, the
condensed porcelain mass is placed in front of or below the muffle
of a preheated furnace at approximately 650 °C. This preheating
procedure permits the remaining water in the condensed ceramic
mass to dissipate. Placement of the condensed mass directly into
even a moderately warm furnace results in a rapid production of
steam, thereby introducing voids or fracturing large sections of
the veneer. After preheating for approximately 5 minutes, the porcelain is placed into the furnace, and the firing cycle is initiated.
At the initial firing temperature, the voids are occupied by the
atmosphere of the furnace. As sintering of the particles begins, the
porcelain particles fuse at their points of contact, and the structure
shrinks and densifies. As the temperature is raised, the sintered
glass gradually flows to fill up the air spaces. Air can still be trapped
because the fused mass is too viscous to allow all the air to escape.
An aid in the reduction of porosity in dental porcelain is vacuum
firing. Sintering is complete when the structure achieves 100% of
the theoretical density. However, this is unlikely to occur even in
the presence of a vacuum because the possibility that all pores will
be eliminated under typical dental sintering conditions is remote.
A few bubbles are present, but they are markedly smaller than the
ones obtained with the usual air-firing method. At a condition of
95% to 99% theoretical density, the dental veneering ceramic is
said to be mature or fully sintered.
In some cases, multiple firings are necessary to fabricate a prosthesis, such as the application of a stain layer for shade adjustment
or for characterization with stain lines or fine cracks. Several chemical reactions occur over time at porcelain-firing temperatures, and
of particular importance are increases in the concentration of crystalline leucite. The presence of leucite content can alter the coefficient of thermal contraction of the porcelain. Some porcelains
undergo an increase in leucite crystals after multiple firings that
will increase their CTE. If the expansion coefficient increases above
that of the metal, the expansion mismatch between the porcelain
and the metal can produce stresses during cooling that are enough
to cause immediate or delayed crack formation in the porcelain.

Cooling
The proper cooling of a porcelain restoration from firing temperature to room temperature is the subject of considerable importance. The catastrophic fracture of glass that has been subjected to
sudden changes in temperature is a sufficiently familiar experience
that most clinicians are cautious about exposing dental porcelain
to rapid cooling (thermal shock) after firing. The cooling of dental porcelain, however, is a complex matter, particularly when the
porcelain is bonded to a metallic substrate. Multiple firings of an
MC restoration can cause the coefficient of thermal contraction of
the porcelain to increase and can actually make the ceramic more
likely to crack or craze because of tensile stress development.
The MC restoration that is shown schematically in Figure 10-4
has a facial metal thickness of 0.3 to 0.5 mm. This is veneered
with opaque porcelain approximately 0.3 mm in thickness. The
body porcelain is about 1-mm thick. Because a ductile metal is
used as an inner core of an MC crown, cracks will not propagate
in the metal, but they can progress through the veneering ceramic
or within the interfacial region. With proper design and physical
properties of the porcelain and metal, the porcelain is reinforced
so that brittle fracture of the veneer can be avoided or at least
minimized. Although most MC restorations involve cast metal
copings, several novel noncast approaches (electrodeposition,
milling, swaging, and burnishing) for the fabrication of metal

CHAPTER 10

substructures have been developed in recent years. The fracture
resistance of MC prostheses made from these core metals is much
less reliable compared with those made from traditional cast metal
copings and frameworks.

Ceramic-Ceramic or All-Ceramic Systems
Recent developments in ceramic products with improved fracture
resistance, advanced CAD-CAM technology, and excellent aesthetic
capability have led to a significant increase in the use of ceramicceramic or all-ceramic products. Ceramic crowns and bridges have
been in widespread use since the beginning of the 21st century. One
of the first hot-isostatically pressed (HIP) core ceramics was IPS
Empress, a leucite-based glass-ceramic. Because of this material’s relatively low flexure strength and fracture toughness, this glass-ceramic
was limited to anterior single-unit restorations. Other ceramics that
were limited to single-unit restorations were Vitadur N aluminous
porcelain; Cerestore magnesia-alumina shrink-free ceramic; and
Dicor, a tetrasilicic-fluormica-based glass-ceramic. Although these
materials had reasonably good success rates for a few years, their
limitations slowly, but surely, led to the development of stronger and
tougher ceramics that allowed for a broader range of uses.

Glass-Ceramics
A glass-ceramic is a material that is formed into the desired shape
as a glass, then subjected to a heat treatment to induce partial
devitrification (i.e., loss of glassy structure by crystallization of the
glass). The crystalline particles, needles, or plates formed during
this heat-treatment process interrupt the propagation of cracks in
the material when an intraoral force is applied, thereby promoting increased strength and toughness. The use of glass-ceramics
in dentistry was first proposed by MacCulloch in 1968. He used
a continuous glass-molding process to produce denture teeth. He
also suggested that fabricating crowns and inlays by centrifugal
casting of molten glass was possible.
The first commercially available castable ceramic material for
dental use, Dicor, was developed by Corning Glass Works and
marketed by Dentsply International. Dicor was a castable glass
that contained 55 vol% of tetrasilicic fluormica (KMg2.5Si4O10F2)
and was formed into an inlay, facial veneer, or full-crown restoration by a lost wax casting process similar to that employed for
metals. This product was derived from the quaternary ceramic
system, K2O-MgF2-MgO-SiO2. Besides this material’s relatively
low flexure strength (110 to 172 MPa) and low fracture toughness
(1.6 to 2.1 MPa•m1/2), the original cast form was colorless, and
prostheses needed to be colored through the application of a thin
layer of shading porcelain. Subsequent products were provided as
dark and light shades of machinable glass-ceramic (MGC). The
flexure strength of Dicor MGC decreased by up to 88% after the
tensile surface was ground.
After the glass casting core or coping was recovered from the
casting investment, the glass was sandblasted to remove residual
casting investment, and the sprues were gently cut away. The
glass was then covered by a protective “embedment” material and
subjected to a heat treatment that caused microscopic plate-like
crystals of tetrasilicic fluormica to grow within the glass matrix.
This crystal nucleation and crystal growth process is called ceramming. Once the glass was cerammed, the glass was then fit on the
prepared dies, ground as necessary, and coated with veneering
porcelain to match the shape and appearance of adjacent teeth.
Dicor glass-ceramic was capable of producing remarkably good

aesthetics, perhaps because of the “chameleon” effect, where part
of the color of the restoration was picked up from the adjacent
teeth and from the tinted cements used for luting the restorations.
When used for posterior crowns, the Dicor glass-ceramic crowns
were more susceptible to fracture than anterior crowns.
More recently, glass-ceramics based on leucite, lithia disilicate,
and hydroxyapatite have been used. These ceramics are available
as powders or as solid blocks that can be machined through CADCAM processes or hot-pressed either as a core ceramic or as a
veneering ceramic. The condensation and processing of ceramic
powders are described in a previous section.

Hot-Isostatically Pressed Glass-Ceramics
Veneered leucite-based glass-ceramic core restorations are indicated
for anterior veneers and crowns and premolar inlays, onlays, and
crowns. Hot-pressed leucite-containing glass-ceramics have been
used for many years. The technology of hot-pressing leucite-based
and lithia-disilicate–based glass-ceramics is well established, and this
technology has recently been applied to the hot-pressing of veneer
ceramics on metals and zirconia core ceramics. The most widely
used leucite-based products are IPS Empress (Ivoclar Vivadent),
Cerpress SL (Leach and Dillon), Finesse (DENTSPLY Ceramco),
and IPS e.max CAD (Ivoclar Vivadent). These glass-ceramics contain approximately 35 vol% of leucite (K2O•Al2O3•4SiO2) crystals. The glass-matrix layering ceramic for these core materials also
contains leucite. These glass-ceramics have relatively low flexure
strength (≤112 MPa) and fracture toughness (1.3 MPa•m1/2), so
they are not recommended for molar crowns or bridges. A partial
listing of HIP core ceramics is given in Table 10-4.
IPS Empress 2 (Ivoclar Vivadent), IPS Eris (Ivoclar Vivadent),
and Optec OPC 3G (Pentron Laboratory Technologies) contain
approximately 65 to 70 vol% of lithia disilicate (Li2O•2SiO2) as the
principal crystal phase (Table 10-1). The lithia disilicate materials
that are used as glass-ceramics have a narrow sintering range, which
makes the processing of ceramic prostheses very technique sensitive. Figure 10-8 shows a schematic cross-section of an all-ceramic
crown made with a lithia disilicate core ceramic. This glass-ceramic
is composed of approximately 70 vol% of lithia disilicate and 30
vol% glass. This glass base contains at least 4% ZrO2, which could
account for this material’s improved strength. This ceramic is fairly
translucent but is somewhat opaquer (Figure 10-9) and a stronger core ceramic than the leucite-based glass-ceramic (Empress).
The mean flexural strength of lithia disilicate is approximately 350
MPa compared with the 112 MPa strength of leucite-based glassceramics. is strength and a fracture toughness of 3.3 MPa•m1/2
for lithia-disilicate–based glass-ceramics are generally sufficient
for most anterior and posterior crowns and for anterior three-unit
bridges even though the flexural strength and fracture toughness of
their layering ceramics are substantially lower. Although the core
ceramic fracture resistance is moderately high, veneered prostheses have been reported to be susceptible to chipping, which may
require replacement or recontouring of the affected prostheses.
Examples of cracking and chipping of these prostheses are shown
in Figures 10-10, 10-11, and 10-12. A follow-up material to lithia
disilicate is lithia silicate material, with minimal change to the
physical properties. The latest iteration of these silicate glasses is the
addition of lithia metasilicate to the lithia disilicate crystals with
the inclusion of 10% ZrO2 in the glass matrix.
Hot-pressed ceramics (IPS Empress, IPS Empress 2, Finesse
All-Ceramic, and OPC-3G) are made by creating a wax pattern, which is invested. Similar to the lost wax technique, this

investment is heated and injected under pressure into the investment mold. This technique can also be used to veneer MC prostheses, as mentioned earlier.

Fluorapatite Glass-Ceramic
Nano-fluorapatite glass-ceramic veneer, such as e.max Ceram
(Table 10-1), has a relatively low CTE (~9.5 × 10–6/K) and is
matched to that of lithia disilicate glass-ceramic core material
and to some alumina and zirconia ceramics. Thus, because of the
higher expansion coefficients of conventional feldspathic porcelain veneers, they cannot be used on lithia disilicate core frameworks. However, the fluorapatite-based layering glass-ceramics are
thermally compatible with these core glass-ceramics. Because of
their sufficiently high-volume fraction of glass-matrix phase, these
ceramics can be acid-etched and bonded to resin cement using
well-established procedures.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Why do zirconia-based ceramics require a stabilizer?

Zirconia-Based Ceramics
Zirconia or zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) is a white crystalline oxide of
zirconium that has an extremely low thermal conductivity, about
20% as high as that of alumina (Al2O3). Zirconia is chemically
inert and highly corrosion resistant and exhibits unique mechanical and electrical properties that make this material extremely useful in such applications as heat insulators, oxygen sensors, and
fuel cells. The first use of zirconia for medical purposes was made
in 1969 in orthopedics as a new material for femoral heads on
total hip replacements. Zirconia has been used in dentistry for
crown and bridge applications since 2004, with the development
of CAD-CAM systems. Dental zirconia should not be confused
with cubic zirconia or zircon. Zircon is a naturally occurring gemstone based on zirconium silicate (ZrSiO4), and cubic zirconia is a
cubic crystalline form of zirconia. Both zircon and cubic zirconia
are used as diamond simulants.
Pure ZrO2 powder has a monoclinic crystal structure at room
temperature and transforms to tetragonal between 1167 and
2367 °C, and then cubic zirconia at temperatures above 2367 °C.
The transition from tetragonal to monoclinic phase results in a

3% to 5% volume increase (Figure 10-13), which produces microcracks in bulk zirconia samples and a reduction in strength and
toughness. Under this condition, pure zirconia would be useless
for dental restorative applications. However, the addition of some
metallic oxides to zirconia has been found to keep the tetragonal
phase from transforming into the monoclinic phase as zirconia
cools to room temperature, preventing the development of microcracks and preserving the mechanical properties of the tetragonal

phase. The process is called doping. The types of oxide include
magnesia (MgO), lime (CaO), yttria (Y2O3), and ceria (Ce2O3).
The oxide-doped zirconia is termed stabilized zirconia. Another
possibility for stabilizing the high-temperature tetragonal phase
at room temperature is to keep the crystal size to less than 10 nm
during cooling.

2.1 MPa•m1/2, and the fracture toughness of tetragonal 3Y-TZP is
approximately 8 to 10.3 MPa•m1/2. This improvement was identified to have been caused by a tetragonal-to-monoclinic transformation, which will be discussed in the following section.

CRITICAL QUESTION
What are the differences among fully stabilized zirconia (FSZ), partially
stabilized zirconia (PSZ), and tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (TZP)?

What microstructural changes occur in 3Y-TZP ceramic at the tip of cracks in
the presence of tensile stress?
Through what mechanism does transformation toughening increase the
resistance of yttria-stabilized zirconia to fracture?

Stabilized Zirconia
If a larger concentration of stabilizer (i.e., more than 8 mol%
yttria) is added, the zirconia becomes all cubic phase and is called
fully stabilized zirconia (FSZ), which is the component of cubic
zirconia and devices such as oxygen sensors and fuel cells. The
increase in volume does not occur in FSZ. The most common
stabilizer for dental applications is yttria in the quantities of 3
to 5 mol%. At that concentration, the oxide-doped zirconia is
known as partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ) or tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (TZP), depending on the microstructure. The
PSZ consists of nanosized metastable tetragonal particles that
have precipitated out in a cubic phase matrix approximately
50 μm in grain size during tempering of cooling cycle. Metastable tetragonal crystallites below a critical size (far below 1 μm)
can be maintained in this form in a densely sintered structure
down to room temperature. These crystallites allow for sintering a highly dense structure termed TZP, with each single crystallite that is almost 100% metastable tetragonal crystallites at
room temperature. Normally, the material is designated by the
quantity of stabilizer before the abbreviation of the stabilizer,
and then the type of microstructure. Therefore 3Y-TZP refers
to 3 mol% Y2O3 tetragonal zirconia polycrystal, and 5Y-PSZ
has 5 mol% Y2O3 partially stabilized zirconia. Magnesia has also
been used to produce an Mg-PSZ core ceramic (ZirMagnum,
Cad.esthetics AB, Skellefteå, Sweden). Ceria is used as a stabilizer
in a Ce-TZP/Al2O3 core ceramic (KZR-CAD NANOZR, Yamakin Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan).
High strengths were discovered to correlate with a high tetragonal phase content, whereas a high amount of monoclinic phase
leads to low strengths. For example, the fracture toughness of a
92% dense nondoped monoclinic zirconia has been reported to be

Transformation Toughening
The structural stabilization of zirconia by yttria results in a significant proportion of metastable tetragonal phase. By controlling
the composition, particle size, and temperature-versus-time cycle,
zirconia can be densified by sintering at a high temperature, and
the tetragonal structure can be maintained as individual grains
(i.e., ZTP) or precipitates (i.e., PSZ), as the structure is cooled
to room temperature. The tetragonal phase is retained in a metastable state at room temperature by internal stress and can transform under certain conditions to a stable monoclinic phase with a
corresponding volume increase. When sufficient stress develops in
the structure, and a crack begins to propagate, causing the metastable tetragonal crystals (grains) or precipitates next to the crack
tip to release the internal stress, the metastable tetragonal phases
transform to the stable monoclinic form. In this process, a 3 vol%
expansion of the ZrO2 crystals or precipitates occurs that places
the crack under a state of compressive stress (Figure 10-14), and
crack progression is arrested. To advance this crack further, additional tensile stress would be required. This phenomenon increases
the flexural and tensile fracture resistance of stabilized zirconia
prostheses and, presumably, the survival probabilities of zirconiabased restorations and is therefore called transformation toughening. Because of this strengthening and toughening mechanism,
the yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic is sometimes referred to as
ceramic steel. Figure 10-15 shows a cross-sectional view of a Lava
crown with a Y-TZP product.
The energy exerted on the surface by grinding may exhibit
surface toughening in principle through the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation; excessive grinding by instruments
with coarse abrasives or large flutes is not recommended by most

zirconia suppliers because deep flaws may offset any advantage
presented by localized compressive stresses. A regeneration heat
treatment of machined or superficially ground Y-TZP at 900 °C
for 1 hour or less at 900 to 1000 °C converts the monoclinic phase
within the surface back to the tetragonal phase. Thus, if veneer firing occurs after a grinding procedure, the thermal treatment can
induce the reverse transformation of monoclinic to the tetragonal
phase in the ground areas of the zirconia structure.
The volume increase in this case is constrained if the zirconia crystals are sufficiently small and the microstructure is strong
enough to resist the resulting stresses. This material is extremely
strong (flexural strength, ≈ 900 MPa) and tough (fracture toughness, KIc, ranges from 8 to 10.3 MP∙m1/2). Many Y-TZP products
are available in dentistry for CAD-CAM processing. These Y-TZP
products fall into three groups: (1) to be milled in the green (compacted) state, (2) to be milled in a partially sintered state, and (3)
to be milled in the fully sintered state.

Monolithic Zirconia
One approach to reducing the fracture susceptibility of ceramic
restorations associated with weaker veneer is to use only core
ceramics to make the entire restoration. Table 10-5 lists some
properties of several core ceramics including a Y-TZP product

and the corresponding veneering ceramic. This method is especially useful in the most posterior areas of molar crowns where
high occlusal clenching forces or parafunctional forces are applied.
Although the fracture resistance of all-zirconia crowns is exceptionally high, there is the potential for undue wear of opposing
enamel. Clinical studies have confirmed that properly polished
monolithic zirconia does not cause excessive wear of opposing
enamel. This is in contrast to glazed monolithic zirconia, which
has been shown to cause excessive wear of enamel, especially after
the glaze has worn off. Two other disadvantages of an all-zirconia
crown are the difficulty in adjusting occlusion when significant
premature contacts are present and the cutting difficulty and heat
generated in removing defective crowns or when making an endodontic access opening with diamond burs.
Another disadvantage of monolithic zirconia is the opaque
nature of this material. To offset this lack of translucency, manufacturers increased the yttria content with the production of 4Y-PSZ
and 5Y-PSZ, where the tetragonal phase is lowered to about 75%
and 50%, respectively, with the balance as cubic phases. With
increase of cubic phase and their larger grain size, these zirconia
materials exhibit greater translucency, thereby improving asthetics. However, reducing the volume of the tetragonal phase leads
to less transformation toughening and lower strength and fracture
toughness of the zirconia. These translucent zirconia ceramics have
strengths similar to lithia disilicate and are therefore indicated for
single-unit restorations only.

Fracture Strength of Zirconia
For zirconia, the fracture toughness tends to increase with
increasing grain size. Therefore the influence of grain size on
transformation toughening is contrary to the increase in fracture
strength for the small grain sizes seen in many other materials.
One study of the influence of grain size on three-point bending strength and Vickers fracture toughness revealed that the
fracture strength increases linearly for 3Y-TZP from 650 MPa
for a 0.9-μm grain size up to 1000 MPa for a critical grain size
of 1.4 μm, after which this decreases to 750 MPa for a mean
grain size of 1.8 μm. The change in fracture strength is mainly

governed by the change in fracture toughness for the grain size
between 0.9 and 1.8 μm. However, this relationship probably
does not apply to nanocrystalline (~100-nm grain size) zirconia
used in dentistry because the mean grain size is much smaller
than the extrinsic defects, such as cracks caused by grinding. Thus
the dependence of fracture strength on grain size should be small
for dental CAD-CAM zirconia. The decrease in strength caused
by very large grain sizes is likely caused by premature transformation, which causes microcracking. Kosmač et al. reported
that grinding reduced the monoclinic content and the flexural
strength of fine-grained zirconia, but grinding did not affect the
flexural strength of coarse-grained zirconia. Curtis et al. reported
that grinding with coarse-grit burs decreased the flexural strength
of zirconia, but grinding with fine-grit burs did not cause a statistically significant change. Other studies listed in the reference
section may present conflicting results because of differences in
the initial microstructure, composition, particle-size distribution,
maximum flaw sizes, and flaw-size distribution.

Hydrothermal Degradation
The long-term performance of Y-TZP may be compromised by this
material’s susceptibility to hydrothermal degradation. Although
hydrothermal effects have been generally reported between 200
and 400 °C, longer exposure times at oral temperatures may also
degrade zirconia, resulting in increased surface roughness, fragmented grains, and microcracks. The degradation process is initiated by a transformation of the surface to the monoclinic phase,
which spreads through the surface grains and into adjacent grains
by stresses that develop during this process. The controlling
mechanism is unknown, although OH– groups are thought to be
responsible for breaking the atomic bonds at the surface, which
produces residual stresses and the initial transformation from the
tetragonal to monoclinic phase.

Glass-Infiltrated Core Ceramics
To minimize sintering shrinkage and to ensure adequate fit of
ceramic prostheses, three glass-infiltrated core ceramic systems
have been developed, one based on partially sintered alumina, one
based on a magnesia-alumina spinel (MgAl2O4), and one with a
zirconia-alumina core. Each of these partially sintered ceramics

can be infiltrated with a lanthanum glass without any significant
dimensional change.
VITA In-Ceram Alumina contains approximately 85 vol% of
alumina. The partially sintered framework is formed by a slipcasting process, which produces dense packing of particles against
a porous die. After firing at 1120 °C for 10 hours or more, a partially sintered structure is formed. This porous core ceramic framework is then infused with molten lanthanum glass. A schematic
illustration of a cross-section of an In-Ceram Alumina crown is
shown in Figure 10-16.
The same type of process can also be applied to In-Ceram Spinel (ICS), which is a magnesia alumina spinel (MgAl2O4) core
ceramic, and In-Ceram Zirconia. After glass infiltration, InCeram Spinel ceramic is more translucent than In-Ceram Alumina or In-Ceram Zirconia, but the mean strength is significantly
lower (~350 MPa vs. ~600 MPa). The mean flexure strength of

CHAPTER 10

219

In-Ceram Zirconia (~620 MPa) is only slightly greater than that
of In-Ceram Alumina.
In-Ceram Zirconia, a zirconia-toughened alumina (ZTA)
material, is not made from a pure zirconia core but, rather, a
combination of 62 wt% alumina, 20 wt% zirconia, and ~18 wt%
infiltrated glass. In-Ceram Zirconia is indicated primarily for
crown copings and three-unit anterior and posterior frameworks
when in a glass-infused form. Because there is no shrinkage associated with this process, the marginal adaptation is expected to be
comparable to that of the hot-pressing method. As with 3Y-TZP
zirconia, ZTA is subject to transformation toughening with
conversion from tetragonal to monoclinic phases in areas where
stress is induced. The result of this process is that the strength
of ZTA is doubled, and the toughness is increased two to four
times. The properties of alumina, ZTA, and 3Y-TZP are summarized in Table 10-6. The ZTA properties are based on an 85%
alumina-15% zirconia product (ZTA-96, Astro Met, Inc., Cincinnati, OH).

using a mechanical profiling device; then a computer converts the
coordinates of the die surface into a digital database. An oversized
die is then produced onto which pure alumina is dry-pressed. The
oversize green alumina body is then sintered, and the resulting
shrinkage yields the desired size and shape onto which a feldspathic porcelain veneer is applied and sintered. The Procera AllCeram core is more translucent than In-Ceram Zirconia and has
comparable strength (620–700 MPa). Because alumina cannot be
acid-etched to produce micromechanical retention, the surface is
sandblasted with silica-coated alumina particles by a Rocatec system (3M ESPE Minneapolis, MN), which is required to ensure
sufficient resin bonding. Figure 10-17, A shows a fractured threeunit alumina-based bridge whose retentive flanges were dimpled
to promote micromechanical bonding. The fracture surface in
Figure 10-17, B shows a relatively large void that may have contributed to the fracture.

Alumina Core Ceramic

Bonding to prosthetic ceramics is important for three reasons:
(1) resin-based composite cements are believed to increase the
retention of all-ceramic prostheses, (2) resin-based composite
cements are believed to increase the fracture resistance and survivability of ceramic restorations, and (3) resin-based composite

is the material of choice for repair of chipped or fractured core or
veneer ceramic. However, silane-based coupling does not bond
chemically to all ceramics. For example, as previously shown
in Figure 10-17, the framework of the fractured resin-bonded
bridge made with an alumina framework could not be etched.
The dimpled area on one of the retained flanges of the bridge
suggests that macromechanical bonding to the resin cement had
been chosen. The clean separation of this framework from the
resin-based cement indicates inadequate bonding. In addition,
examination of the fractured flange indicates the presence of
a large void that may have contributed to the fracture of the
connector.
The mechanism of silane-based primer bonding to a silica network of silica-based ceramics is well known. In addition, abrasive
blasting and acid-etching of the glass matrix of these ceramics create surface irregularities that can further enhance the retention of
the resin cement. The penetration of the adhesive resin into the
macroscopic irregularities, combined with chemical bonding, may
also inhibit water access to the ceramic surface, thereby enhancing
the durability of bonded ceramic prostheses. Furthermore, acidetching can blunt the tips of microcracks within the ceramic surface. This blunting process reduces the stress concentration at the
crack tips. If any voids are trapped within the interface between
the crown and cement in the occlusal area, occlusal loads above
this site can generate tensile stresses in the ceramic that may cause
crack formation or fracture.
Silane primers or coupling agents have dual functionality,
including an unsaturated group for polymerizing to adhesive resins
and resin-based composites and methoxy groups (–OCH3) that are
hydrolyzed to silanols (Si–OH) for bonding to inorganics such as
silica-based ceramics or metal oxide substrates through the formation of siloxane (–Si–O–Si–) bonds or (–Si–O–M–) bonds on other
metal oxide substrates. Silane primers provide covalent bonds that
promote adhesion at the interface between polymers and hydrolytically stable silica-based substrates, assuming that the substrate is free
of contaminants. Figure 10-18 shows a schematic illustration of the
bonding stage of silane primer or adhesive to a silica-based ceramic.
The reaction of silanes with silica-based ceramics involves four
stages: hydrolysis, condensation, hydrogen bonding, and bond
formation. After hydrolysis of the methoxy groups, condensation
to oligomers occurs, and the oligomers then hydrogen bond with
–OH groups of the substrate. Then, during curing, covalent links
are formed with the substrate, with simultaneous loss of water.
These reactions typically occur simultaneously after the initial
hydrolysis stage.

Although a monolayer of silane-based primer is preferred, multilayer adsorption generally occurs. Estimated thicknesses from
deposition of a 0.25% silane solution onto glass range from three
to eight molecular layers. Kitayama et al. reported that silane-based
monomers produced the best bonding to silica-based ceramic, and
monomers that are based on either phosphate ester or phosphonic
acid monomers produce better bonding to zirconia. These bonding mechanisms are described in Chapter 6, Mechanisms of Adhesion and Primers.

CRITICAL QUESTIONS
What causes stress concentrations? How can they promote the fracture of
all-ceramic prostheses even in the presence of low occlusal forces?

CAD-CAM Processing of Ceramics
Computer-aided milling of metals, composites, and ceramics is
now possible because of advances in imaging devices, software,
and CAD-CAM milling systems. CAD-CAM ceramic prostheses can be produced either as monolithic lithia disilicate glassceramic or zirconia ceramic structures or as bilayer structures
made from milled copings and layered manually, by hot pressing
or by fusing a CAM-produced veneer to the framework (CAD-on
method). A ceramic veneer that is pressed on metal is referred
to as the press-on metal (POM) method. CAD-CAM prostheses can be produced either by industrial milling processes or by
chairside milling units. The industrial CAD-CAM systems are
very expensive, with typical costs in excess of several hundred
thousand USD. However, they are capable of processing multiple
jobs with a high level of accuracy and reproducibility. Chairside
systems are limited in their processing speed and their ability to
process large cases.
Layered zirconia prostheses can be produced from partially sintered ceramics and shaped by carbide burs to enlarged dimensions
that compensate for sintering shrinkage. Fully sintered ceramics
are shaped by diamond disks and burs to the precise dimensions
derived from a scanned image of the prepared teeth. Typically, the
external surface must be ground and polished manually, although
some CAD-CAM systems are capable of milling the external surface. Figure 10-19 shows a simulated digitized image of a crown
to be produced from a ceramic blank and an adjacent image of a
partially milled crown. Figure 10-20 shows a Cerec ceramic block,
a milled inlay form, and the final inlay.

As mentioned previously, zirconia ceramics can be milled in the
green state, in the partially sintered state, or in the fully sintered
state. A four-unit Cercon core ceramic framework can be milled in
the green state (Figure 10-21); after simulated try-in (Figure 10-22);
and after sintering, staining, and glazing the veneering ceramic
(Figure 10-23). A typical procedural sequence for producing
ceramic prostheses by a CAD-CAM system using partially sintered
blanks is as follows:
1. Set the blank in the milling machine holder according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Set the enlargement factor to compensate for sintering
shrinkage. The factor will vary according to the overall size of
the prosthesis.
3. Insert the appropriate machining/milling tool.
4. After machining is completed, remove the framework and
residual blank.
5. Cut the framework from the blank using a diamond disc.
6. Clean the partially sintered framework completely.
7. Dry the framework completely.
8. Place the framework in the isothermal hot zone of the sintering furnace.
9. Set the thermal processing conditions according to the sintering instructions for the specific product.
10. Sinter the framework to achieve optimum density.
11. After cooling, remove the sintered framework.

• Figure 10-23 Final Cercon fixed dental prosthesis with veneering ceramic and stain characterization. (Courtesy Dentsply Ceramco, Burlington, NJ.)

12. Inspect the framework for surface and subsurface flaws using
fiberoptic transillumination.
13. Evaluate the framework for adequacy of wall thickness, ease
of seating, and marginal fit.
14. If necessary, use a water-cooled diamond tool to perform
minor adjustment corrections.
15. Rinse the framework thoroughly with water, and dry it completely.
16. Depending on the zirconia product, the framework may
be used with or without a veneering ceramic. If a veneering
ceramic is indicated, a transitional liner may be required prior
to the application of the veneering (layering) ceramic.
Chairside milling is the ultimate goal of CAD-CAM processing. Until recently, the ability of a dentist to process his or her
own ceramic prostheses was limited by the lack of skills in layering the veneering ceramic on the milled and fully sintered coping or framework. Because of the experience gained over many
years with the Cerec system, many dentists are now able to fabricate inlays, onlays, and crowns from leucite-based ceramic blanks
(ingots) and lithia-disilicate–based glass-ceramic blanks. Blanks
with gradations of translucency and color, such as those developed
for the VITABLOCS TriLuxe Forte (VITA Zahnfabrik) ceramic
line, allow clinicians to produce single-unit finished prostheses

without the need for skills in the layering of a veneering porcelain.
The weak link in all-ceramic prostheses is the relatively low fracture resistance of the veneering ceramics (Table 10-7).
The quality and precision of the more costly commercial
imaging, designing, and milling systems have increased markedly since the 1980s because of advances in the software that
controls these variables. Thus it is likely lab-operated CADCAM systems will continue to support crown and bridge needs
well into the future.
A summary of the processing of the different core ceramics and
their processing techniques is shown in Table 10-8.

Methods for Strengthening Ceramic
Restorations
Brittleness and low tensile strength are the two principal deficiencies of ceramics. Methods of overcoming these deficiencies fall into
two general categories: changing microstructures by physical or
chemical means and minimizing stress concentration of prostheses
by reducing inherent surface flaws and redesigning components.
Physical means of strengthening brittle materials can be achieved
by either the introduction of residual compressive stresses or the
interruption of crack propagation through the material. These two

CHAPTER 10

strategies for strengthening brittle materials and specific methods
based on these strategies are discussed next.

Minimizing the Effect of Stress Concentrations
Why do dental ceramic prostheses fail to exhibit the strengths that
we would expect from the high interatomic bond forces? The answer
is that numerous minute scratches and other flaws are present on
the surfaces of these materials. These surface flaws behave as sharp
notches whose tips may be as narrow as the spacing between several
atoms in the material. Under intraoral loading, the tensile stresses
that develop within the ceramic structure are greatly increased and
concentrated at the tips of these flaws. The stress concentration
geometry at the tip of each surface flaw can increase the localized
stress to extremely high levels even though the average stress that
exists throughout the bulk of the structure is relatively low. When
the induced localized tensile stress exceeds the nominal strength of
the material structure, the bonds at the notch tip rupture, forming
a crack. There are other variables that affect the magnitude of these
stresses and microcrack stability, including prosthesis design, load
orientation, loading rate, microstructure, and residual processing
stresses. These variables are discussed in other chapters.
Discontinuities in ceramic structures and in other brittle materials can cause a stress concentration in these areas. The design
of ceramic dental restorations should be carefully planned with
sufficient bulk and a minimum of sharp angular changes to avoid
stress raisers in the ceramic. Abrupt changes in shape or thickness
in the ceramic contour can act as stress raisers and make the restoration more prone to failure. For example, the incisal line angles
on an anterior tooth prepared for a ceramic crown should be well
rounded, and the amount of occlusal reduction for molar teeth
should provide sufficient bulk for the ceramic product under
consideration. Figure 10-24 shows an MC pontic that has fractured because of a high stress concentration at the incisal edge.
Even though an MC restoration is generally more fracture resistant
than most ceramic crowns of the same size and shape, care must
be taken to avoid subjecting the porcelain in an MC prosthesis to
loading that produces large localized stresses. If the occlusion is
not adjusted properly on a porcelain surface, contact points rather
than contact areas will greatly increase the localized stresses in the

• Figure 10-24 Porcelain debonding from a metal pontic substrate of a
long-span metal-ceramic bridge.

Ceramic-Based Materials

223

porcelain surface and within the internal surface of the crown.
These contact stresses can lead to the formation of the so-called
Hertzian cone cracks that often lead to chipping of the occlusal
surface. A small particle of porcelain along the internal porcelain
margin of a crown also induces locally high tensile stresses. A stray
particle that is fused within the inner surface of a shoulder porcelain margin of an MC crown can cause localized tensile stress
concentrations in porcelain when an occlusal force is applied to
the crown.
As the crack propagates through the material, the stress concentration is maintained at the crack tip unless the crack moves
completely through the material or until this crack meets another
crack, a pore, or a crystalline particle, which may reduce the localized stress. The removal of surface flaws or the reduction of their
depth and number can produce a very large increase in strength.
Reducing the depth of surface flaws in the surface of a ceramic is
one of the reasons that polishing and glazing of dental porcelain
is so important.

CRITICAL QUESTION
True or false? Residual compressive stress develops in the veneering ceramic
of an all-ceramic crown in the same way as it does in an MC crown.

Maximize Development of Residual Compressive
Stresses
Recall that when an MC prosthesis is cooled from the sintering
temperature, the metal and veneering ceramic contract at different
rates because of differences in their thermal contraction coefficients.
Meanwhile, the chemical bond between the metal and the porcelain prevents the two components from separating; this condition
forces the two components to adjust their respective dimensions
at the interface as the MC cools. The adjustment of dimension
results in stresses evolved at the interface. The instantaneous stress
at a given temperature during the cooling cycle is termed transient
stress, and the stress distribution, which exists at room temperature, is called the residual stress. Keep in mind that the materials
adjacent to the interface are also under stresses but to a lower level
away from the interface. In an earlier discussion, we called an MC
system thermally compatible when the residual stress developed
is insufficient to cause separation or immediate cracking of the
porcelain or delayed cracking after cooling to room temperature.
However, the type of stress developed in the ceramic component
is of concern. Because ceramic is weak in tensile strength, the presence of any residual tensile stress within the ceramic will make the
ceramic fracture at a lower stress level. In other words, the residual
stress within the ceramic should be compressive.
Additional methods of introducing residual compressive stress
near the surface of ceramics without using several materials of different CTE, such as ion exchange and thermal tempering, are also
discussed in the following section.

Coefficient of Thermal Expansion Mismatch
As discussed earlier, a slightly higher contraction of the metal can
induce a residual compressive stress in the ceramic component
when MC is cooled to room temperature. Figure 10-25 shows
that the ceramic component is under compression in the hoop
and axial (tangential) directions but pulled in the radial direction toward the metal coping by a tensile stress. Figure 10-26
shows a two-dimensional (axial and radial axes) illustration of the

to the cutout slab does not represent a stress but the projection of the area

additive effects of tangential tensile stress (+20 MPa) induced in
the porcelain veneer by intraoral forces and residual stress produced by thermal contraction differences. Assuming that the
coefficient of thermal expansion of metal is greater than that
of porcelain (αm > αp), and that there is a residual compressive
stress of -40 MPa, the combined effect is -20 MPa of tangential compressive stress (Figure 10-26, A). Note that the residual
compressive stress in the tangential direction actually increases the
“effective” tensile strength of porcelain because this net compressive stress (-20 MPa) must first be overcome before tensile stress
can develop by the applied intraoral force on the facial surface of
porcelain. The residual compressive circumferential (hoop) stress
(Figure 10-25) should increase the fracture resistance of the MC
bond as the residual compressive tangential stress does.
Conversely, a thermal contraction mismatch that results from a
higher coefficient of contraction of porcelain (αp > αm) will introduce residual tangential and hoop tensile stresses. That means
the resistance of the porcelain to tensile failure is reduced by as
much as the residual tensile stress. The additive effect of tangential tensile stress induced in the porcelain by the intraoral force
can exceed the tensile strength of the porcelain and cause crack
propagation in the porcelain veneer (Figure 10-26, B). When the
contraction coefficient of the porcelain is much lower than that of

the ceramic.

Thermal Tempering
Perhaps the most common method for strengthening glasses in
general usage is by thermal tempering. Thermal tempering creates
residual surface compressive stresses by rapidly cooling (quenching) the surface of the object while hot and in the softened state.
This rapid cooling produces a skin of rigid glass surrounding a soft
core. As the softened core solidifies, the core tends to shrink, but the
outer skin remains rigid. The pull of the hardening core on the outer
skin during shrinking generates residual compressive stresses within
the outer surface while the core experiences residual tensile stresses.
Thermal tempering is used to strengthen glass for uses such
as automobile windows and windshields, sliding glass doors, and
diving masks. A more effective approach for dental applications is
quenching hot glass-phase ceramics in a silicone oil bath or other
special liquids. This thermal tempering treatment induces a protective region of compressive stress within the surface. However,
this process is technique sensitive because large counterbalancing
tensile stresses may develop when excessive cooling rates occur
during the tempering process.

Interruption of Crack Propagation
the metal, porcelain cracking or MC bond failure can occur near
the metal–porcelain interface (Figure 10-27). This incompatibility
failure is likely caused by the development of radial tensile stresses
that exceed the tensile strength of porcelain.
The principle of strengthening by thermal expansion mismatch can also be applied to all-ceramic systems. One method is
to choose veneering ceramics whose thermal expansion or contraction coefficient is slightly less than that of the core ceramic.
Consider three layers of porcelain, the outer two of the same
composition and coefficient of thermal contraction and the
inner layer of a different composition with a higher coefficient
of thermal contraction. Suppose that the layers are bonded
together, and the bonded structure is allowed to cool to room
temperature. The inner layer has a higher coefficient of thermal
contraction and tends to contract more on cooling. Thus on
cooling to room temperature, the inner layer produces axial and
hoop compressive stresses in the adjacent outer layer. The ability to produce this protective compressive stress to the ceramic
structure before the crown is cemented to prepared teeth should
increase the fracture resistance and survival probability of the
prosthesis.

Ion Exchange
The technique of ion exchange is an effective method of introducing residual compressive stresses into the surface of a ceramic. If
a sodium-containing glass article is placed in a bath of molten
potassium nitrate, potassium ions in the bath exchange places
with some of the sodium ions on the surface of the glass article
and remain in place after cooling. Because the potassium ion
radius is about 35% larger than that of the sodium ion, the diffusion of the potassium ion into the place formerly occupied by
the sodium ion causes crowding of atoms on the surface, creating
residual compressive stresses on the surface. Increases of 100%
or more in the flexural strength of feldspathic porcelains have
been achieved with several ion-exchange products that contain
a significant concentration of small sodium ions. However, the
depth of the compression zone is less than 100 μm. Therefore this
strengthening effect could be lost if the porcelain or glass-ceramic
surface is ground, worn, or eroded by long-term exposure to certain inorganic acids.

When we discuss the fracture of an object, we often attribute the
cause to crack propagation. Thus stopping, impeding, or redirecting the crack propagation can prevent or delay fracture until a
greater external force is applied. The increase in stress to fracture
an object is the result of strengthening. There are two approaches
to interrupting crack propagation, as discussed next.

Crystalline Particle Strengthening
Reinforcement of ceramics with a dispersed phase of a different
material can prevent or inhibit the propagation of cracks. This
process is referred to as dispersion strengthening. When small, tough
crystals are homogeneously distributed in a glass, the ceramic structure is toughened and strengthened because cracks cannot penetrate
the fine particles as easily as through the glass. This technique was
applied decades ago in the development of aluminous porcelains (in
which Al2O3 particles were dispersed in a glassy porcelain matrix) for
all-porcelain crowns. Most current dental veneering ceramics have
a glassy matrix that is reinforced by a dispersed crystal phase. Glass
matrices in dental ceramics have been strengthened and toughened
by a variety of dispersed crystalline phases, including leucite, lithia
disilicate, alumina, and tetrasilicic fluormica.
Almost all modern higher-strength ceramics derive their
improved fracture resistance from the crack-blocking ability of
crystalline particles. Hot-pressed core ceramics and veneering glassceramics contain a glass phase that is strengthened with crystalline
particles of leucite, lithia disilicate, alumina, magnesia-alumina spinel, and other types of crystals. Toughening depends on the crystal
type, crystal size, volume fraction, interparticle spacing, and CTE
relative to the glass matrix. For example, the fracture toughness
(KIc) of soda-lime-silica glass is 0.75 MPa•m1/2. If one disperses
approximately 34 vol% of leucite crystals in the glass, such as in
IPS Empress, KIc increases only to 1.3 MPa•m1/2. However, by dispersing 70 vol% of interlinked lithia disilicate crystals in a glass
matrix, such as in IPS e.max Press, KIc, increases to 3.3 MPa•m1/2.
Transformation Toughening
In contrast to dispersion strengthening, the ability of a material to
undergo a stress-induced transformation that hinders crack propagation is known as transformation toughening. A good example is
tetragonal zirconia polycrystals in zirconia-based dental ceramics

that undergo a transformation into a stable monoclinic crystal
upon the impact of growing microcracks. A detailed discussion is
presented in the section of Stabilized Zirconia.

Summary
The fracture resistance of ceramic prostheses can be increased
through one or more of the following six options: (1) select
stronger and tougher ceramics; (2) develop residual compressive
stresses within the surface of the material by thermal tempering;
(3) develop residual compressive stress within interfacial regions of
weaker, less tough ceramic layers by properly matching coefficient
of thermal expansion; (4) reduce the tensile stress in the ceramic
by appropriate selection of stiffer supporting materials (greater
elastic moduli); (5) design the ceramic prosthesis with greater
bulk and broader radii of curvature to minimize the magnitude of
tensile stresses and stress concentrations during function; and (6)
adhesively bond the ceramic crowns to tooth structure.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Which processing technique is most likely to generate the deepest flaws in a
ceramic core framework?

Effect of Design on Fracture Susceptibility of
Metal-Ceramic and All-Ceramic Restorations
There are many examples of atypical designs that lead to ceramic
fracture of MC restorations. Tougher, stronger ceramics can sustain higher tensile stresses before cracks develop in areas of tensile
stress. Conventional feldspathic porcelains should not be used as
the core of ceramic crowns, especially in posterior areas, because
occlusal forces can easily subject them to tensile stresses that
exceed the tensile strength of the core ceramic. Because the forces
on anterior teeth are relatively small, low to moderate tensile
stresses can be supported by ceramic crowns more safely. However,
if there is a great amount of vertical overlap (overbite) with only

a moderate amount of horizontal overlap (overjet), high tensile
stresses can be produced.
When fractures occur, a sketch of the observed fracture surface is helpful to assist in determining the cause of fracture. An
illustration of the main crack patterns that can develop in an MC
crown is shown in Figure 10-28. Some cracks travel along the
metal–metal oxide interface, and others may propagate along the
interface between the metal oxide and opaque porcelain. The third
type can occur cohesively within porcelain entirely. The first two
types are indicative of a material processing error, and the third
may be indicative of a crown design error, excessive loading, or
other uncontrollable factors.
Although ceramic and MC prostheses are susceptible to design
errors, some variations in design have minimal effects on the stress
levels generated during loading. For example, the MC crown
designs shown in Figure 10-29 have quite different metal thicknesses in the facial area, yet finite-element analyses reveal no significant differences in the maximum principal tensile stresses that
develop under simulated loading.
Sharp line angles in the preparation also will create areas of stress
concentration in the restoration, primarily where a tensile component of bending stress develops. A small particle of ceramic along
the internal porcelain margin of a crown can induce locally high
tensile stresses during try-in or final cementation. Furthermore,
when grinding of this surface is required for adjustment of fit,
one should use the finest-grit abrasive that will accomplish the
task. This precaution will reduce the probability of forming microcracks and will reduce the depth of microfissures that are produced by the abrasive particles. Grinding flaws in the inner surface
of ceramic crowns represent the greatest damage that can be produced in ceramics by processing techniques.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Describe four ways by which control of tooth preparations and the design of
crowns and bridges can increase the resistance to fracture of all-ceramic
crowns.

Most ceramics should be designed in such a way as to
overcome their weaknesses, that is, the relatively low fracture
toughness and tensile strength of veneering ceramics and their
susceptibility to crack formation in the presence of surface flaws.
The design should avoid exposure of the ceramic to high tensile
stresses. Knife-edge margins should be avoided because of the
risk of cracking or chipping during the try-in phase. The tensile
stresses in a ceramic FDP can be reduced by using greater connector thicknesses (Figure 10-30) and by broadening the radius
of curvature of the gingival embrasure (Figure 10-31) portion
of the interproximal connector. However, a connector height
greater than 4 mm in the posterior area of the mouth is often
unrealistic because of shorter crowns and can result in bulky,
unaesthetic connectors (Figure 10-32). Fractured connectors are
fairly common, especially when the connector size is less than
that recommended by the manufacturer. Figure 10-33 illustrates
an example of this design deficiency. The distal connector of

fractured after 18 months in service, and the mesial connector
fractured later. The distal connector was only 3.5 mm or 0.5
mm less than was recommended. Quinn et al. studied the effect
of stress concentration factor (Chapter 4, Stress Concentration)
in the gingival embrasure area on the predicted minimum connector size needed for a four-unit zirconia framework to ensure
a 95% survival against fracture over a period of 20 years. The
results confirm the importance of geometrical features on the
maximum stress and the corresponding probability of failure
(Figure 10-34).

Principles for Selection of Dental Ceramics
A properly made MC crown is more fracture resistant and more
durable than most all-ceramic crowns and bridges. This technology is well established compared with the technologies required
for the most recent all-ceramic products. Although the biocompatibility of some metals used for copings and frameworks may be
a concern for patients who have known allergies to those metals,
these situations are rare. A metal coping or framework provides
an advantage compared with zirconia-based ceramic prostheses
when endodontic access openings though crowns are required.
Temporary repairs for ceramic fractures that extend to the metal
framework are possible, without the need for intraoral sandblasting treatment, by using current resin bonding agents. All-ceramic
crowns can be more susceptible to chipping fracture and to bulk
fracture in posterior sites. Fractures of ceramic connectors represent another disadvantage of all-ceramic prostheses, especially
when the manufacturer’s recommendations for connector shape
and size cannot be applied. Overall, the aesthetic appearance of
an all-ceramic restoration is generally superior to that of an MC

restoration for anterior and posterior situations. However, properly designed MC crowns are highly aesthetic when adequate
tooth-reduction principles are satisfied. In addition, metal coping
designs, such as thinner facial metal (0.1 to 0.5 mm) and/or knifeedge facial metal margins, or collarless metal margins can further
enhance the aesthetic potential of these anterior crowns.
Although an all-ceramic crown exhibits superb aesthetics, some
all-ceramic bridges are not as aesthetic because the connectors must
be sufficiently thick to minimize the risk for fracture, or the core
ceramic is excessively opaque. Some all-ceramic crowns will not
be aesthetic if the tooth preparations are inadequate, particularly
when insufficient tooth structure has been removed. Not all
patients will benefit from the placement of all-ceramic crowns or
bridges. Some individuals exhibit certain characteristics that would
allow only a metal or MC bridge to be used. For example, if an
individual bruxes frequently and with great force, an all-ceramic
bridge would not be likely to survive. A ceramic bridge should not
be placed in patients who have a long span across the pontic site
because the higher stresses under function could lead to premature
fracture. There are several clear indications and contraindications

• Figure 10-34 The fatigue curve is the result of finite-element analysis showing the minimum connector diameter required for a four-unit
all-ceramic bridge made from 3 mol% Y2O3 tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (3Y-TZP) to ensure a survival rate of 95% for at least 20 years.
Other parameters used in the analysis are mastication frequency of
1400 cycles/day and maximum cyclic stress of 346 MPa. The stress
concentration factor (K) is the ratio of maximum stress in the gingival embrasure area (Figure 10-34) to either the nominal or net-section
stress across the connector. The clench curve shows the connector
diameter needed to prevent fracture under the same stress of 346 MPa
(single cycle) for comparison. (Adapted from Quinn GD, et al: Fatigue of
zirconia and dental bridge geometry: design implications, Dent Mater
26:1133–1136, 2010.)

Ceramic-Based Materials

that should be kept in mind when treatment planning crown and
bridge cases made with a ceramic system. Therefore all-ceramics
are preferred over MCs when aesthetics is a prime concern, when
MC aesthetics is unacceptable, or when a history of metal hypersensitivity exists. Table 10-9 lists the types of dental ceramics by
their recommended indications for and contraindications against
their use based in part on evidence from clinical studies. Although
manufacturers and dental laboratory owners usually list the indications for use of ceramic products, they do not typically state their
contraindications. Only after clinical evidence of adverse events
occur do the indications change and contraindications become
more clearly specified. The information presented does not guarantee success nor is it predictive of failure, because many variables
are involved that may shift the balance of risk from low to high.
The toughest and strongest core ceramics have opaque cores
that are veneered with layers of translucent ceramic. The prediction of the most durable ceramic should be based on the fracture
resistance of the entire bilayer or trilayer system, not simply of the
core ceramic itself. In the absence of randomized, controlled clinical data, in vitro tests of the monolithic ceramic materials and of
layered ceramics that simulate the designs used in clinical practice
are highly desirable. For example, Figure 10-35 shows the mean
fracture loads across three strength ranges of three-unit bridges
made using four ceramic materials. If more bridges had been
tested, Weibull analyses could have been performed on the data
to determine the reliability and fracture probabilities over time.
More importantly, finite-element models can be developed for any
prosthesis design that can be applied with dynamic fatigue data
for the component ceramic materials using Life Ceramics Analysis
and Reliability Evaluation software (CARES; NASA) to predict
the time-dependent probabilities for fracture.

The success or failure of ceramic restorations can be related
to material-, dentist-, lab-, technician-, and patient-related factors. The specific cause of failure often results from failure to
follow the manufacturer’s guidelines. For example, feldspathic
porcelain must be supported by a metal coping or high-strength
ceramic core to resist occlusal loading and prevent excessive
flexural strain and should not be used as the core ceramic for
a ceramic-ceramic crown. The comparative fracture toughness
values of ceramics are listed in Tables 10-5 and 10-6. Another

cause of fracture is inadequate occlusal reduction on premolar and molar teeth. A minimum of 1.5-mm reduction is recommended for MC crowns in molar areas, compared with a
thickness of 2.0 mm for most ceramic crowns. However, the
introduction of monolithic zirconia crowns suggests that occlusal reductions as low as 0.6 mm may be adequate in some cases.
For any ceramic product, the tooth-preparation guidelines recommended by the manufacturer should be followed for the
specific ceramic that will be used. These guidelines should be

CHAPTER 10

discussed with the lab technician to ensure that standardized
procedures are followed.
When a dentist writes a prescription for an MC or ceramic
prosthesis, specific information is required on the material to be
used and the design that is needed. How should these decisions be
made by a competent clinician? The intraoral conditions and optimal treatment options must first be considered. For missing teeth,
restoring the dentition to occlusal function may be accomplished
with implants and crowns or FDPs. The aesthetic needs, expectations, and financial resources of the patient are the next criteria to
be considered. The treatment choice is then made on the basis of
anticipated success rates, survival times, and minimization of risk
factors that are determined from published clinical studies and the
previous experience of the clinician, the dental lab technician, and
their colleagues. For recent dental school graduates, the previous
experience is often based on the materials and techniques learned
in dental school. For well-established dentists, experiences in dental practices complement their dental school and advanced education training. Although one may have developed an extensive base
of experience, the decision matrix of materials, design options,
techniques, experience, patient conditions, and predicted success
rates represents an overwhelming combination of variables to factor into optimal treatment decision making.
The dental literature provides convincing evidence that the
most durable types of posterior prostheses are those produced
from high-noble alloys, particularly gold-based alloys. However,
the profession has entered an aesthetics-oriented phase in which
decisions tend to favor appearance over long survival times. Thus
the selection of dental materials products tends to favor the use of
resin-based composites and ceramics for single-unit and multipleunit restorations. In many cases, MC material systems are chosen

Ceramic-Based Materials

231

over all-ceramic systems as a compromise between aesthetic needs
and minimizing the time-dependent probability of failure or maximizing survival.
The dentist and lab technician are faced with a complex challenge of deciding which ceramic should be used for each specific
clinical situation. Although some products are recommended for
posterior three-unit to five-unit FDPs, one should first consider
the use of all-metal FDPs or MC FDPs because these prostheses
will have a much greater life expectancy. Only when a patient
is highly resistant to accepting metallic components during the
treatment-planning discussions should all-ceramic FDPs be used
because the fracture resistance of posterior all-ceramic FDPs is
based on (1) the strength and fracture toughness of the ceramic
components, (2) the connector dimensions (minimum height
of 4 mm), (3) connector shape (gingival embrasures must have
broad radii of curvature), and (4) the patient’s biting force. Thus
the selection of a ceramic for these prostheses is a very risky
proposition because optimal conditions for their success are not
yet known.

IdentCeram Certificates for Identification of
Ceramic Products
IdentAlloy certificates have been used by dental labs for many
years to identify alloys that are used in prosthetic cases sent by
the lab to dentists. Because of the strong recent demand for
all-ceramic prostheses, IdentCeram certificates were introduced
in 2007 to identify the manufacturer/company, brand name, and
composition of the materials used for all-ceramic prostheses. Six
of the IdentCeram certificates are shown in Figure 10-36. The

• Figure10-36 IdentCeram certificates.

letter codes are designated as follows: AO (aluminum oxide), YZ
(yttrium zirconia), LD (lithia disilicate glass-ceramic), FA (fluorapatite glass-ceramic), LE (leucite glass), and LG (leucite glassceramic). There are newer certificates such as HC (hybrid ceramic)
and ZLS (zirconia lithium silicate) not featured here. The certificates exhibit a recognizable letter code that helps ensure proper
insurance coding. These codes correspond to IdentAlloy codes
for high noble (HN), noble (N), and predominantly base metal
(PB) alloys. By using these widely recognized certificates, labs and

dentists gain a proven, practical way to document this information in their patient charts and ensure consistent communication
with their dental lab technicians.
