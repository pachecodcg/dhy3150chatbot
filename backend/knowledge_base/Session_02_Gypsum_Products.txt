GYPSUM: DEFINITION AND SOURCES
================================================================================

DEFINITION

Gypsum is a naturally occurring mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate 
(CaSO4 · 2H2O). The mineral contains water of crystallization.

HISTORICAL NOTE

The largest mineral crystals in the world are composed of varieties of gypsum 
and occur in the Cueva de los Cristales (aka Giant Crystal Cave) in the Naica 
Mine, Chihuahua, Mexico.

SOURCES

Gypsum is mined from naturally occurring deposits and then processed for a wide 
variety of applications, including dental uses.

PROCESSING STEPS

1. CRUSHING: The gypsum is transported to a crushing facility where it is 
   broken down into smaller pieces.

2. DRYING: The gypsum is dried to reduce surface moisture.

3. GRINDING: The gypsum is pulverized into a fine powder.

4. CALCINATION: The gypsum is heated to remove water of crystallization, 
   converting it into calcium sulfate hemihydrate to form the different types 
   of powders used to form dental models and dies.

================================================================================

precise restorations

================================================================================
GYPSUM CHEMISTRY
================================================================================

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION

Naturally Occurring Gypsum (Dihydrate): CaSO4 · 2H2O

When gypsum dihydrate is heated through calcination (removal of water of 
crystallization), it becomes:

Calcium Sulfate Hemihydrate: CaSO4 · 1/2H2O

This hemihydrate form is what becomes dental stone powders.

When water is added to the hemihydrate during mixing:

Setting Reaction: Hemihydrate + Water = Dihydrate (Stone Dental Model)
CaSO4 · 1/2H2O + Water = CaSO4 · 2H2O

SETTING REACTION CHARACTERISTICS

Exothermic: The setting reaction releases heat
Heat released: 3,900 cal/gm mole

The setting is ALL about:
1. Dissolution of hemihydrate (solubility)
2. Precipitation of dihydrate crystals (insolubility)

================================================================================
5 TYPES OF DENTAL STONE

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT STONE COLOR

Dental stones come in different colors, but color does NOT indicate stone type. 
Do not assume that color indicates a specific dental stone type. Always read 
the label to determine the correct type.

================================================================================
CALCINATION PROCESS
================================================================================

DEFINITION OF CALCINATION

Calcination is the process of heating gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) to 
remove water of crystallization, converting it into calcium sulfate hemihydrate.

The key point: Do not lose the water molecule during calcination! The 
hemihydrate form (with 1/2 water molecule) is what becomes dental stone powder.

METHOD AFFECTS PROPERTIES

The method used to remove water through calcination creates the five different 
types of dental stone, each with different particle characteristics:

Open Atmosphere Heating (110-120°C)
- Results in β form hemihydrate
- Creates irregular, porous particles
- Produces Types I and II (Plaster)

Pressure in Water Heating (125°C)
- Results in α form hemihydrate
- Creates more uniform, larger particles
- Produces Type III (Dental Stone)

Boiling in 30% Calcium Chloride Solution
- Results in α form hemihydrate
- Creates most dense form with largest particles
- Produces Types IV and V (High-Strength Stone)

PARTICLE SIZE AND POROSITY RELATIONSHIPS

More Porous Particles (Plaster - Types I, II)
- Larger surface area
- Require more water (45 ml per 100 g)
- Weaker final product
- Faster setting

More Dense Particles (High-Strength Stone - Types IV, V)
- Smaller surface area
- Require less water (19-24 ml per 100 g)
- Stronger final product
- Slower setting

================================================================================
SETTING REACTION
================================================================================

THE EXOTHERMIC NATURE OF STONE SETTING

The conversion of hemihydrate to dihydrate is an EXOTHERMIC reaction, meaning 
it releases heat during the process. This heat generation is a key 
characteristic of gypsum setting.

DIMENSIONAL CHANGE PARADOX

Theoretical vs. Actual Change

Theoretically: There should be a 7% volume DECREASE when converting hemihydrate 
to dihydrate.

Logically: Models should contract upon setting - RIGHT?

However: In practice, models actually EXPAND upon setting (0.2-0.4% linear 
expansion).

EXPLANATION: FORMATION OF CRYSTAL SPEARS ON SETTING

The key to understanding this apparent paradox is the crystal structure that 
forms during setting.

As dihydrate forms and precipitates from solution, crystals elongate and push 
other crystals apart. This mechanical pushing action causes expansion on setting 
(0.2-0.4% linear expansion).

The process:
1. Hemihydrate particles (small, irregular) are in the mix
2. Water dissolves hemihydrate particles
3. Dihydrate precipitates and forms long, needle-like crystal structures (called 
   "crystal spears" or "urchins")
4. These growing crystals physically push surrounding particles apart
5. This mechanical pushing causes the overall expansion of the set material

This expansion offsets the theoretical volume decrease, resulting in a net 
expansion of the set model.

PROPORTIONS NEEDED

Theoretical requirements (theoretical):
1 gm mole plaster + 1.5 gm mole water = 1 gm mole dihydrate

In reality: Need more water to make workable

More porous the particle, more water needed:
- Leads to excess free water that weakens product
- Another reason model drying is so important

================================================================================
WATER TO POWDER RATIO (W/P)
================================================================================

DEFINITION AND IMPORTANCE

The W/P (water-to-powder) ratio affects:
- Concentration of components
- Setting time
- Expansion during early set
- Final strength
- Workability

DIFFERENT RATIOS FOR DIFFERENT STONE TYPES

Different hemihydrates need different amounts of water to wet surfaces due to 
differences in:
- Porosity
- Density
- Surface area (SA)

FOR EVERY 100 G OF HEMIHYDRATE:

Type I and II Plaster (Porous)
- Surface Area: High (↑SA)
- Water needed: 45 ml per 100 g powder
- Result: Very porous mixture, more water, weaker

Type III Dental Stone (Moderate Density)
- Surface Area: Medium (→SA)
- Water needed: 30 ml per 100 g powder
- Result: Moderate porosity

Type IV and V High-Strength Stone (Dense)
- Surface Area: Low (↓SA)
- Water needed: 19-24 ml per 100 g powder
- Result: Dense mixture, less water needed, stronger

EFFECTS OF EXCESSIVE W/P RATIO

As W/P Ratio increases:
- Prolongs setting time
- Weakens the final product
- Decreases expansion during early set

Explanation: The "urchins" (crystal spears) must be spaced further apart and 
need to be longer to push them apart to cause expansion and achieve proper 
setting. This requires more nucleation sites and affects the crystal formation.

Optimum stone properties are obtained at the correct W/P ratio for each stone 
type.

EFFECT ON STRENGTH AND EXPANSION

- Correct W/P ratio: Optimal strength and expansion properties
- Excessive W/P ratio: Reduced strength, reduced expansion
- Low W/P ratio: Maximum strength but may compromise workability

================================================================================
SETTING REACTION: FACTORS AFFECTING SETTING TIME
================================================================================

SPATULATION

Definition and Effect:
Spatulation breaks up growing crystals and creates more sites for formation of 
new crystallization centers.

Effects of increased spatulation:
- Increased spatulation = Decreased setting time (faster)
- Each broken piece starts to send out spines
- Denser number of nucleation sites
- Increased pushing apart of particles
- Slight increase in expansion

Clinical Implication: Be consistent with spatulation time for predictable 
results.

WATER TEMPERATURE

Effect on Solubility:
As water temperature increases above 37°C (body temperature), the solubility of 
the HEMIHYDRATE DECREASES.

Result: Higher water temperature SLOWS DOWN setting

Explanation: Decreased solubility means the hemihydrate doesn't dissolve as 
readily, slowing the precipitation of dihydrate crystals.

Clinical Recommendation: USE ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER to obtain proper setting 
time

EFFECT OF HUMIDITY

Water enters powder if left open:
- Forms dihydrate
- Can speed up setting reaction
- If excessive, can retard setting

Implications for storage:
- Containers should be kept shut or sealed
- Use pre-proportioned packs for consistency
- High humidity can affect setting time predictability

EFFECT OF COLLOIDS

Colloidal substances that retard setting:
- Blood
- Saliva
- Agar
- Alginate

How they work:
- These coat hemihydrate particles
- Keep them from reacting
- Create soft, easily abraded surface
- Retard the setting reaction significantly

Clinical importance:
- One reason why IMPRESSION RINSING is so important before pouring stone
- Residual alginate or blood on impression can drastically slow or inhibit 
  setting

Potassium Sulfate effects:
- Decreases both expansion and accelerates setting
- (Remember its inhibiting effect of Borax on alginate setting?)

PRODUCTS FOR SHORTENED SETTING TIMES

Specific products are designed to provide shortened setting times:
- Snap-Stone and similar products
- Adding a small amount of slurry water will greatly decrease setting time
- Adding the DIHYDRATE form which acts to form new crystallization sites
- More nucleation sites = faster setting

================================================================================
IMPORTANT TERMS: SETTING TIMES
================================================================================

WORKING TIME (Initial Setting Time)

Definition: From start of mix until stone becomes semi-solid

Purpose: Time provided to allow operator manipulation

Indication: Indicates PARTIAL setting reaction

Clinical significance: This is the window of time during which the stone can be 
manipulated without distortion

FINAL SETTING TIME

Definition: From start of mix until stone becomes rigid and can be separated 
from the impression

Indication: Indicates completion of MOST of setting reaction

Important note: Stone is NOT at maximum strength yet - this is a chemical 
measure of when setting is essentially complete

Relationship between times:
- Working time: When manipulation stops being effective
- Final setting time: When material is rigid enough to remove from impression
- Maximum strength: Occurs much later after drying

================================================================================
MIXING PROCEDURES
================================================================================

HAND MIXING METHOD

Step-by-step procedure:

1. Water in bowl FIRST, THEN powder sifted slowly
   - Never add water to powder
   - Add powder to water in controlled manner
   - This prevents lumps and ensures proper hydration

2. Let sit 30 seconds
   - Allows powder to absorb water
   - Promotes complete wetting of particles

3. Use flat-bladed, stiff metal spatula
   - Not a whisk
   - Flat blade allows better contact with bowl
   - Stiff spatula provides better control

4. Use stropping motion
   - Move spatula across bowl surface
   - Press mixture against sides
   - Not a whipping or circular motion
   - This breaks up air bubbles mechanically

5. Vibrate to remove air bubbles
   - Use vibrator at end of mixing
   - Remove surface bubbles
   - Ensures denser mix

POWER MIXING vs. HAND MIXING

Optimum, consistent properties obtained using POWER MIXING

Advantages of power mixing:
- Under vacuum
- Fewer voids
- Higher strength
- Shorter setting time
- Less setting expansion
- More consistent results batch to batch

Disadvantages of hand mixing:
- More variable results
- More voids trapped
- Lower strength
- Less predictable setting time

Clinical recommendation:
For critical applications (dies, casts), power mixing is recommended. Hand 
mixing is acceptable for study models.

================================================================================
MODEL SEPARATION
================================================================================

TIMING: WHEN TO SEPARATE

After you are sure of the initial set:
- Takes 45 to 60 minutes for stone to gain initial strength
- After exotherm is done (loss of gloss is NOT an indicator)
- Use the final setting time as a guide

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ALGINATES

Separate after exotherm is gone (about an hour)

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: DO NOT LEAVE OVERNIGHT

Why this is important:
- Alginate in contact with stone will absorb water from stone surface
- Resulting in weakened material
- If leave too long, might break teeth when removing impression
- Alginate acts like a sponge, drawing moisture from the stone

Clinical implications:
- Remove alginate impressions promptly after stone sets
- Don't leave models in impressions to dry or for convenience
- Minimize time impression and stone are in contact

================================================================================
MODEL DRYING AND STRENGTH
================================================================================

STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT

Maximum stone strength does not occur until excess water is removed.

1 HOUR STRENGTH (Wet Strength)
- Stone has initial set but contains excess water
- Much weaker than final strength
- Careful handling required

24 HOUR STRENGTH (Dry strength)
- Most excess moisture has evaporated
- Approximately 2X the wet strength
- For each type stone, dry strength is typically about 2X wet strength

Strength progression:
- Immediately after setting: Very weak (mostly water)
- 1 hour: Initial strength achieved, can remove from impression
- 24 hours: Substantially stronger (2X)
- 1 week: Maximum strength (at room temperature)

DRYING PROCESS

Excess moisture (8.8% water content) takes a LONG time to leave naturally
- 1 week at room temperature is typical

Accelerated drying:
- Commercial model heaters used to speed drying
- Must be careful not to drive off water of crystallization

Temperature guidelines:
- Not in excess of 60°C (140°F)
- At higher temperatures, hemihydrate starts to form
- Anhydrous CaSO4 forms at even higher temperatures
- This destroys the crystalline structure needed for strength

Consequence of overheating:
- Hemihydrate formation
- Complete loss of strength
- Model becomes unusable

IMPORTANCE OF PROPER DRYING

Reasons drying is critical:
- Excess free water weakens product
- Models must reach proper strength for functional use
- Wet models easily damaged during trimming
- Proper drying allows full strength development

================================================================================
MODEL TRIMMING
================================================================================

WATER EROSION CONCERNS

Casts/models are susceptible to water erosion from model trimming

The problem:
- High-speed trimming with water spray erodes stone
- Water washes away stone particles
- Surface becomes rough and weak
- Detail is lost

RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE

Preparation:
1. Use set model at least 24 hours old
2. Soak in solution of slurry water for 1-2 minutes prior to trimming

Benefits of slurry water pre-treatment:
- Minimize water erosion during trimming
- Prevent sludge from trimming form sticking to cast surface
- Creates protective layer on surface
- Maintains surface detail

Technique:
- Use gentle pressure with trimmer
- Don't force the trim
- Use coolant sparingly
- Work carefully to maintain margins and details

================================================================================
3D PRINTED MODELS AND DIES
================================================================================

PRINTED DENTAL MODELS

3D printing technology has become viable for creating dental models. These 
printers use photopolymer or resin-based materials to create accurate replicas 
of dental structures.

Advantages:
- Consistent quality
- No waiting for stone to set and dry
- Can produce multiple copies from same file
- Excellent surface detail
- Durable material
- Environmentally friendly alternative

Technology:

Materials (Basel). 2020 Sep 13(18): 4066
Published online 2020 Sep 13
DOI: 10.3390/ma13184066

Finding:

DOI: 10.14368/jdras.2020.36.4.242

Finding:
The conventional dies were more accurate than 3D printed dies, though 3D 
printed dies were within clinically acceptable range.

Conclusion:
Thus, 3D printed dies can be used for fabricating restorations, and 3D printed 
dental dies are acceptable substitutes for conventional stone models.

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE

- 3D printed models are acceptable for diagnostic purposes
- 3D printed dies are acceptable for laboratory work
- Within clinically acceptable accuracy ranges
- Good alternative when conventional gypsum products not available

Limitations:
- Some applications still prefer conventional stone
- Cost considerations
- Learning curve with new technology
- Material properties differ from stone

Advantages:
- Faster workflow
- Consistent quality
- Multiple copies easily made
- Reduced material waste
- Environmental benefits

QUICK REFERENCE: DENTAL STONE TYPES
================================================================================

TYPE     NAME                          W/P RATIO    MAIN USE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I        Impression Plaster            45 ml/100g   Friable/flabby tissues
II       Model Plaster                 45 ml/100g   Study models, mounting
III      Dental Stone                  30 ml/100g   Study models, base for dies
IV       High-Strength Stone           19-24 ml/100g Final casts/dies (lower exp)
V        High-Strength High-Expansion  19-24 ml/100g Final casts/dies (high exp)

================================================================================
KEY CONCEPTS TO REMEMBER
================================================================================

1. Setting is exothermic and involves crystal formation that pushes particles 
   apart, causing expansion despite theoretical volume decrease.

2. W/P ratio is critical and varies by stone type due to particle porosity and 
   surface area differences.

3. Spatulation, water temperature, humidity, and colloids all affect setting 
   time significantly.

4. Distinction between working time (partial set), final setting time (rigid, 
   removable), and maximum strength (after drying) is essential.

5. Models must dry adequately (1 week at room temp or using dryers at appropriate 
   temperature) to reach maximum strength.

6. Alginate impressions must be separated from stone promptly to prevent water 
   absorption that weakens models.

7. Hand mixing produces variable results; power mixing under vacuum is preferred 
   for critical applications.

8. Color of dental stone does NOT indicate type - always read the label.

9. 3D printed models and dies are now acceptable substitutes for conventional 
   stone products.

10. Proper technique and timing at each stage (mixing, setting, separation, 
    drying, trimming) is essential for optimal results.
