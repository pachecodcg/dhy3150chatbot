## Lecture 3: Composite Resins

### Introduction
Composite resins are the most commonly used direct restorative materials in modern dentistry. They consist of an organic resin matrix reinforced with inorganic filler particles.

### Composition

**Resin Matrix (20-30% by volume):**
- Bis-GMA (bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate)
- UDMA (urethane dimethacrylate)
- TEGDMA (triethylene glycol dimethacrylate)

**Filler Particles (70-80% by volume):**
- Glass particles
- Quartz
- Silica
- Types: microfill, hybrid, nanofill

**Coupling Agent:**
- Silane (connects filler to matrix)

**Initiator System:**
- Camphorquinone (light-activated)
- Chemical initiators (self-cure)

### Polymerization

The polymerization process converts monomers to polymers through:
1. Free radical addition polymerization
2. Initiated by light (visible blue, 400-500 nm)
3. Results in cross-linked polymer network

**Polymerization Shrinkage:**
- Typical range: 2-6% volumetric
- Causes: conversion of van der Waals forces to covalent bonds
- Clinical significance: marginal gaps, microleakage, postoperative sensitivity

### Material Properties

| Property | Typical Range | Clinical Significance |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Elastic Modulus | 10-20 GPa | Stiffness, stress distribution |
| Flexural Strength | 80-150 MPa | Resistance to fracture |
| Compressive Strength | 250-400 MPa | Occlusal load bearing |
| Filler Content | 70-85 wt% | Mechanical properties, polishability |
| Polymerization Shrinkage | 2-6% | Marginal integrity |
| Water Sorption | 20-50 μg/mm³ | Dimensional stability, degradation |

### Classification by Filler Size

| Type | Filler Size | Applications | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------|------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Macrofill | 10-100 μm | Obsolete | High strength | Poor polishability, wear |
| Microfill | 0.04 μm | Anterior esthetics | Excellent polish | Lower strength |
| Hybrid | 0.6-1 μm + nanofillers | Universal | Balance of properties | Moderate polish |
| Nanofill | 20-75 nm | Universal | Good polish, strength | More expensive |

### Clinical Applications

**Anterior Restorations:**
- Class III, IV, V
- Direct veneers
- Diastema closure

**Posterior Restorations:**
- Class I, II (small to moderate)
- Require adequate isolation
- Incremental placement technique

### Key Clinical Considerations

1. **Isolation:** Critical for bonding success
2. **Layering:** Incremental technique (≤2mm layers) to minimize shrinkage stress
3. **Light curing:** Adequate intensity (>400 mW/cm²) and duration (40s minimum)
4. **Finishing:** Immediate gross finishing, delayed final polish (24 hours)

### Common Failure Modes
- Marginal fracture/chipping
- Bulk fracture (inadequate support)
- Secondary caries (marginal leakage)
- Discoloration/staining
- Wear (opposing natural teeth)
