================================================================================
ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES
================================================================================

MATERIALS AND ITEMS NOT PERMITTED DURING EXAMS

certifying that the Code of Conduct rules were upheld during the exam, 
including acknowledging that the work was the student's alone.

GRADES AND FEEDBACK
Question statistics will be reviewed and grades released immediately after 
each exam.

================================================================================
EXCUSED ABSENCE POLICY
================================================================================

OBTAINING AN EXCUSED ABSENCE
Students must follow established protocols through the Dental Hygiene Program 
and/or the Office of Student Affairs to obtain an excused absence.

MISSED QUIZ PROCEDURES
Excused Absence: The quiz will be exempt from the grade calculation
Unexcused Absence: The student will receive a zero

MISSED EXAM PROCEDURES
Excused Absence: The exam will be rescheduled
Unexcused Absence: The student will receive a zero

================================================================================
IN-COURSE REMEDIATION
================================================================================

CORE PRINCIPLES
The Dental College of Georgia is dedicated to each student's academic success. 
The remediation policy encompasses the following core principles:

1. EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND TIMELY REMEDIATION
Students performing below the passing threshold after 25-30% of course 
assessments, or immediately after midterm, are promptly identified for 
remediation. A plan is initiated and executed to allow for academic recovery 
before further assessments.

2. STRUCTURED AND DOCUMENTED REMEDIATION MEETINGS
Students in need of remediation will meet with the course director or 
appropriate faculty to develop a personalized remediation plan based on 
current documented deficiencies. All plans require documentation and must be 
approved by designated faculty or the program director to ensure fairness and 
consistency.

3. OUTCOME-BASED ASSESSMENT
Remediation effectiveness is assessed through post-remediation evaluations. 
Students must pass these evaluations for inclusion in the final grade, with 
any retest scores capped at the lowest passing grade (e.g., low C or 75%).

MULTIPLE REMEDIATION PLANS
Students undergoing three remediation plans within a single course may be 
subject to departmental academic review and potentially referred to the 
Student Academic Review Committee (SARC). This policy supports high 
educational standards and student success.

================================================================================
COURSE FAILURE REMEDIATION
================================================================================

FAILING GRADE CONSEQUENCES
A failing grade in this course will result in a formal referral from the 
Course Director to the Student Academic Review Committee (SARC). The Dental 
Hygiene Program Director will recommend to the Associate Dean of Academic 
Affairs one of the following:
  - Academic Dismissal
  - Voluntary student withdrawal

This referral will be based on identified deficiencies in the student's 
knowledge, clinical or preclinical skills, and/or professional values.

SARC EVALUATION AND RESPONSE
SARC will evaluate the recommendation in the context of the student's overall 
academic performance and the institution's Academic Progress Policy. If SARC 
determines that the student may continue in the program, a structured 
remediation plan will be developed and overseen by the Academic Development 
Coordinator.

REMEDIATED COURSE COMPLETION
Successful completion of the remediation plan will allow the student to 
progress; however, the highest possible grade recorded for a remediated course 
is a "C".

================================================================================
INCOMPLETE GRADES
================================================================================

DEFINITION AND CONDITIONS
The assignment of an incomplete grade indicates that satisfactory work was 
being completed, but for nonacademic reasons beyond the student's control, 
the full requirements of the course were not able to be met.

INCOMPLETE GRADE PROCEDURES
If an Incomplete grade ("I") is earned:
1. The course director will send notification in writing of the time 
   limitations and requirements to remove the "I" grade
2. This notification is subject to approval by the Student Academic Review 
   Committee and the Dean

COMPLETION TIMELINE
1. When the work is completed, the course director is responsible for 
   submitting the grade earned to replace the "I" grade within 3 working days 
   of completion
2. Any "I" grade not replaced by an earned grade within the semester in 
   residence following the assignment of the "I" grade will be changed to a 
   grade of "F" (or "U" in the case of "S"/"U" grade modes)
3. An Incomplete Extension must be approved by the Associate Dean of Academic 
   Affairs

MONITORING RESPONSIBILITY
The Associate Dean for Academic Affairs (Chair of Student Academic Review 
Committee) is responsible for monitoring resolution of "I" grades.

================================================================================
FAILING GRADES POLICY
================================================================================

GRADUATION REQUIREMENT
Students must pass all courses within the curriculum to be eligible for 
graduation.

COURSE REPETITION
When a failing grade of "F" or "U" is recorded for not meeting the course 
requirements, the student must be reregistered for the course to allow for 
remediation before a passing grade can be earned.

REMEDIATED GRADE CAP
The highest grade that can be earned on a remediated course is a "C".

================================================================================
