KEY TERMS
Accelerated lifetime testing A research strategy that allows prediction of the performance of products over a long term based
on tests conducted rapidly in the laboratory.
Accuracy The tendency of a test method to provide a result that is
close to the correct result or the tendency of a statistical model
to make a prediction that is close to a later observation.
Clinical relevance Conducting research in a way that closely mimics the conditions present in the clinic and in the patient.
Clinical significance A difference or change in product performance that actually affects the patient’s quality of life.
Design of experiments A research strategy that allows efficient
screening and optimization of design factors.
Effective volume The volume of a hypothetical test specimen
with uniform stress distribution, such as in pure tension, that
would have the same probability of fracture as an actual specimen of interest with nonuniform stress, such as a specimen
tested in flexure mode.

Finite-element analysis An engineering analysis method for
predicting the development of stress and strain in structures or
the flow of energy or fluids through those structures.
In vitro research The testing of materials, drugs, and devices
that is conducted in a basic science laboratory instead of being
conducted in living test subjects.
Precision The tendency of a test method to consistently provide
the same result.
Specification A document that describes one or more mandatory
test methods and, in some cases, minimum acceptable levels of
performance for a product.
Statistical significance A difference or change in product performance that is unlikely to be caused by random sampling error.
Technique sensitivity The tendency of some products to perform
differently when manipulated by different operators.

In vitro research is the testing of materials, drugs, and devices
that is conducted in a basic science laboratory instead of being
conducted in living test subjects. This could mean measuring the
degradation of materials when they are exposed in a test chamber that simulates the chemical composition and temperature
of the oral environment, or testing could include measuring the
mechanical response in a load frame or passing ultrasonic pulses
through test specimens. In other cases, visible light may be measured as light is reflected and transmitted by a specimen to determine the color shade and translucency of the material. Reflection
of infrared radiation and x-rays may also be measured to determine the molecular structure and the crystal structure of materials, respectively. In vitro tests may be conducted using synthetic
materials to hold the specimen in place, or the specimen may be
held by cadaver tissues. Virtual testing may be performed using
three-dimensional (3-D) computer models to predict the performance of dental prostheses made from different materials. These
are only a few examples of the many in vitro test methods used in
the research of dental materials and devices. Some tests involve
placing materials in a culture of living human or bacterial cells and

observing the cellular response. The interpretation of a living indicator provides a greater variety of factors to consider, so cell culture tests are discussed separately in Chapter 17, Biocompatibility.

The Role of In Vitro Research
Students and professionals who are familiar with the topic of
evidence-based medicine may recall that in vitro research is often
placed low in the hierarchy of evidence. The vertical location of
each layer in the evidence pyramid (Figure 18-1) indicates the
relative weight that should be applied to that type of research in
deciding whether a novel dental material or device performs well
clinically. The width of each layer in the pyramid indicates the
relative amount of that type of evidence that is available in the scientific literature. One important aspect of in vitro research is that
there is a large volume of evidence available. However, each bit of
in vitro evidence should be weighted lightly while making decisions about new dental products because those data—although
intended to predict clinical performance—are not actually gathered in a clinical situation and may have little predictive power

individually. Despite these drawbacks, in vitro research still has
an important impact early in the process of developing a dental
product. In vitro results can bolster confidence in the safety of a
product (as measured in terms of chemical durability, mechanical durability, and lack of toxicity) and in the efficacy of a product (as measured in terms of esthetics, dimensional accuracy, or
antimicrobial activity, for example). This confidence is necessary
before conducting clinical studies to avoid endangering human

test subjects and is necessary before conducting animal studies to
avoid being wasteful in the allocation of those expensive and timeconsuming studies.

There are many combinations of manufacturing parameters to
be tested in the development of a new dental product. Besides
the safety considerations discussed previously, the work requires a
great number of specimens to be fabricated and tested. This means
that it is important for in vitro tests to be precise, rapid, and inexpensive relative to clinical testing. Figure 18-2 shows a flowchart
illustrating how the workflow might be conducted when optimizing the formulation of a dental composite that includes a novel
comonomer. Optimization of a new dental composite is a topic
that has been the focus of much previous research, so for researchers developing the flowchart, guessing as to which few design
parameters will be the most important to control and vary is fairly
easy. Other types of projects contain a greater number of variables. For example, dental implants sometimes have 25 different
design features, and it may not be obvious from the outset which
design features have the greatest impact on the performance of
the implant. Even if each design parameter was tested in only two
conditions, then a full factorial study would require fabricating
and testing 225 = 33,554,432 groups of implants! In such cases,
researchers employ powerful statistical methods with the assistance

Why is it important for in vitro tests to be precise, rapid, and inexpensive

of research software (design of experiments [DOE] and accelerated lifetime testing [ALT]) or use engineering simulation software (finite-element analysis [FEA]) to conduct in vitro research
as efficiently as possible.
DOE is a research strategy that involves three steps: (1) screening design factors to determine which ones have the greater effect
on performance, (2) identifying the combination of choices for
the important factors that correspond to maximum possible performance (the optimal formulation; i.e., best balance of properties
among those being investigated), and (3) identifying the combination of choices near the optimal formulation that results in the
lowest variability in performance (the least technique-sensitive
formulation). The first step in DOE is usually conducted using
orthogonal arrays. Orthogonal arrays are lists of various combinations of choices for the design factors. Each combination corresponds to a different formulation or test group, and the list is
constructed to be as short as possible by making the simplifying
assumption that the importance of each design factor is independent of the choices for the other factors (no interactive effects).
Orthogonal arrays can be quite efficient. For example, only eight
test groups are needed to screen seven factors when the factors
have two settings each. The second step in DOE involves using
response-surface methods or sequential minimum-energy design
to efficiently explore several possible choices or levels for each
remaining factor. After the design space has been explored, the
design corresponding to the maximum performance (strength,
patient satisfaction, shelf life, etc.) or the minimum cost is identified. Compromise formulations can also be identified to satisfy
multiple performance criteria simultaneously. The third step in
DOE uses Taguchi robust design. This is similar to the second step,
except minimum variability is treated as a performance objective,
and a compromise formulation can be identified between minimizing variability and maximizing other performance measures.
Minimizing variability is important for dental products because
the dentists or dental lab technicians who will use the products
have different levels of experience and have different personal habits of preparing teeth and manipulating materials. A techniqueinsensitive material system performs similarly regardless of the
level of experience of the operator. In the case of a dental restorative material, for example, it is desirable for the product to have
decreased technique sensitivity in addition to lending itself to
forming restorations with a long average lifetime.

• Figure 18-3 Regression model for accelerated lifetime testing (ALT).
Specimens are tested in vitro at multiple stress levels, all of which are
more severe than the stresses encountered in the clinical case. A Weibull
distribution is fit to the lifetime data. For each in vitro stress level, the characteristic lifetime (η) by which 63.2% of the in vitro failures have occurred
can be used in an extrapolation to predict the characteristic lifetime that
the dental product would have if used in clinical cases.

ALT can be conducted as constant-stress accelerated lifetime
testing (CSALT) or as step-stress accelerated lifetime testing
(SSALT). In CSALT, each specimen encounters only one level of
stress from the beginning of the test up to the moment when failure is recorded, such as one amplitude of stress in the case of a
chewing simulation. In SSALT, a test specimen starts at a specified
low stress. If the test unit does not fail at a specified time, stress
on the unit is raised and held for a specified time, again. Stress is
repeatedly increased until the test unit fails or the censoring time
is reached. This leads to more rapid testing. However, researchers may have less confidence in clinical lifetimes forecasted from
SSALT data than those forecasted from CSALT data.
It is important to remember that both types of predictions are
extrapolations, and they include a great amount of uncertainty compared with clinical data. There is also a possibility that the levels of
stressors, such as temperature or rate of mastication, may be elevated
so greatly during ALT that degradation processes that would never
occur in the oral cavity may be activated in addition to the processes
that are being accelerated. In this case, inaccurate lifetime predictions
are made. ALT can be used in conjunction with DOE by selecting
clinical lifetime predictions as a performance measure to be maximized. In addition to predicting useful material lifetime in the oral
cavity, ALT can also be used to predict the shelf-life of auxiliary dental
materials such as alginate impression materials.

Accelerated Lifetime Testing

Virtual Modeling

ALT is used to predict the performance of dental materials over a
long period in the patient’s mouth based on tests conducted rapidly
in the research laboratory. This is accomplished by testing material
specimens at several stress levels (all of them being greater than the
stress level of the clinical case). A statistical model is fit to the data to
forecast the lifetime that would probably be observed at clinical stress
levels (Figure 18-3). In ALT, the term stress is used in a general sense
of the response of materials to an external stimulus and does not necessarily imply units of mechanical stress (such as MPa). Nonetheless,
mechanical loading is the most common type of stressor used in ALT,
but other challenges (i.e., temperature, humidity, etc.) may also be
applied either singly or simultaneously.

FEA is an engineering analysis method for predicting the development of mechanical stress and strain or predicting the flow of
energy (heat, electricity, magnetic fields, etc.) or the flow of fluids
through structures. Current applications of FEA are aided by 3-D
models and specialized computer software. A solid model may
be fabricated using computer-aided drafting (CAD) software,
or the model may be imported from a clinical scanner (microcomputed tomography [micro-CT]; Figure 18-4, A). This allows
the modeling of precisely machined parts, such as dental implant
components, and the modeling of parts with custom geometry,
such as fixed dental prostheses and bones and other tissues (see
Chapter 15, Digital Technology in Dentistry).

The heat map (known to researchers as stress contour plot) shows the magnitude of stress on each location of the implant, where hotter colors correspond to high levels of tension
and cooler colors correspond to compression or low levels of tension. B, The physical implant specimen

by the finite-element model to have the highest stress. (Courtesy Dr. Yuanyuan Duan.)

The solid model is divided into thousands or millions of
minuscule volume elements (Figure 18-4, A), and each element is
assigned properties according to the material that constitutes that
portion of the model. Using a greater number and smaller size
of elements results in more accurate predictions but also requires
more computing time and/or power. An important test of accuracy that is often neglected involves solving an FEA problem
multiple times, with an increasing number of elements in each
iteration. The results should converge on a limiting value. If such
a convergence test is not present with the reported results, then
the FEA predictions may not be accurate. The absolute level of
stress predicted cannot be trusted in this case, but the pattern of
the stress distribution still provides useful information regarding
the locations of higher and lower stress concentration in a dental
prosthesis (Figure 18-4, B).
The most common results to be predicted using FEA are the
stress and strain resulting from mechanical loading. That type of
analysis requires inputting material properties of Young’s modulus
and Poisson’s ratio (Chapter 4, Stress-Strain Properties). The accuracy of material properties depends on the method used to measure them, and if inaccurate material properties are input to the
model or if invalid assumptions are made regarding the anisotropy
(direction dependence) of these properties, then the FEA results
will be invalid. Stress and strain results can be exported to additional postprocessing software that combines these results with
material fatigue testing data to predict the probability of failure
by a specified elapsed time for each element in the finite-element
model and to predict the probability of failure for a dental prosthesis or implant as a whole. FEA can be used in conjunction
with DOE by selecting the probability of failure as a performance
measure to be minimized.

CRITICAL QUESTION
What factors lead to a lack of accurate forecasting in ALT?

Clinical Relevance of In Vitro Tests
For some classes of dental materials, there are in vitro tests that
can predict the performance of a given formulation or the comparative ranking for different formulations, but performance can
be difficult to predict for other applications or classes of materials. For example, David Mahler showed that marginal fracture or
“ditching” in dental amalgam fillings can be predicted by tests of
creep resistance. His finding was that the more ditching-resistant
amalgams lacked a γ2 phase in the microstructure, and that the
formation of the γ2 phase could be avoided by increasing the copper content of the amalgam alloy. The resulting high-copper amalgams produced dental fillings with greatly improved longevity. On
the other hand, Jack Ferracane compiled material property data
from a variety of in vitro tests, and he concluded that the clinical failure of composite restorations is a complex, multifactorial
process that cannot be predicted from an in vitro test or a combination of tests. However, in the early development and screening stages of new dental materials, in vitro tests remain the only
tools we have and thus the best tools that we can use to make an
educated guess regarding which material formulations will exhibit
superior performance.

Precision Versus Clinical Relevance
There are often several competing in vitro tests that can be used
to measure a single material property. For example, dentin bond
strength can be measured by a microtensile bond-strength test, a
button shear test, or a crown-removal test (Figure 18-5). There
are even several variations in the geometry of the test specimen or
the method of load application to choose from when conducting
each of these three test methods. In these cases, there is usually
not a single test method that has superior performance in testing
all kinds of hypotheses related to a particular material property.
Rather, the various test methods are usually distributed across a

μTBS specimens do not share the similarities with the clinical case
listed previously for the crown-removal test. The button shear test
is somewhere in between the crown-removal and μTBS tests and
is not as well suited for precision testing or for clinically relevant
testing compared with either end of the spectrum. There are some
difficulties with preparing buttons having consistently equal surface area. Recall from the discussion of shear stress in Chapter 4,
Shear Stress that stress distribution upon mechanical loading is
not a constant stress across the adhesive–tooth interface (nor even
pure shear or pure tension at the interface). Whether the button
is loaded using a wire loop (Figure 18-5), flat blade, or a rounded
blade, the shear bond test does not provide much precision, and it
also does not closely resemble the clinical case.

Salazar Marocho.)

spectrum that has a high level of clinical relevance on one end
and a high level of precision on the other end.
In the case of dentin bond-strength evaluation, the removal of an
actual dental crown from a real tooth (that was previously extracted
with permission of the patient) may have more clinical relevance
than the other two test methods. Obviously, the bonded area and
the configuration of the crown-removal test specimen are the same
as in the clinical case, which means that the operator will have the
opportunity during specimen preparation to create a similar number and size distribution of flaws that would be present in a clinical
cementation. In addition, the line angles are similar to those in the
clinical case, which means that there will be a similar profile of stress
concentration. The prepared specimens should also have a similar
thickness of the cement layer, marginal gap size, and opportunity
for hydrolytic degradation when stored in a simulated environment.
The C-factor (ratio of bonded to nonbonded surface area) is also
similar to that of the clinical case, which provides the same opportunity for polymerization-induced stress to develop at the margin
(Chapter 5, Cure Shrinkage and Managing Shrinkage Stress). However, testing an actual dental crown also leads to variability from one
specimen to the next because teeth are unique in their overall shape,
the dimensions of their dentinal tubules, and the degree of mineralization. Thus a lack of precision in the test results can be expected
for the crown-removal test, and this may make detection of any
improvements in bond strength resulting from novel bonding treatments impossible if those improvements are small.
The microtensile bond-strength test (μTBS) is at the other
end of the spectrum. μTBS specimens are fabricated by exposing a flat cross-section of dentin, bonding a restorative material
to that flat section, and then slicing the resultant layered specimen julienne-style by making a series of parallel cuts along both
orthogonal directions. The final specimens are miniscule in size
and are shaped like sticks with the bonded interface perpendicular to the long axis of each stick. There is a high degree of precision because the interface is flat and because several specimens
are prepared from the same tooth. Different bonding protocols
can even be compared on the same tooth by placing a barrier in
the middle of the sectioned tooth during bonding. However, the

CRITICAL QUESTION
When is it more important to use a precise test instead of a clinically relevant
test?

The Weibull Size Effect
Recall da Vinci’s observation that the tensile strength values of iron wires decreased as the length of the wire increased
(Chapter 4, Fracture of Restorations). The work of Griffith showed
that the nominal strength of the material was dependent on the
size of the flaws distributed within the material. Consider that each
unit of volume in a test specimen contains a variety of microscopic
flaws, with a somewhat random distribution of flaw sizes. Thus
a larger specimen having more units of volume also has a higher
probability of containing a large flaw than does a specimen with
a smaller volume. All other factors being equal, the strength of a
specimen is controlled only by the size of the specimen’s largest
flaw, so large specimens tend to have lower strengths on average.
Griffith’s work explained the physical basis of da Vinci’s observation
but did not provide a quantitative relationship between the physical size of the specimen and the strength value. That quantitative
relationship was later provided by Waloddi Weibull’s extreme value
distribution (known today as the Weibull distribution).
In ranking the strengths of different prosthetic materials or in
comparing bond strengths yielded by different dentin bonding protocols, it is important to compare data from similarly sized specimens to
avoid the influence of the size effect on the strength values. From the
bond-strength test examples presented earlier, one should note that
different types of tests use different sizes of specimens, making the
comparison between testing groups difficult. When the size of the test
specimen is smaller than the actual size of the restoration in service,
the comparable material strength values in the form of a restoration
would be of interest to the manufacturers. The statistical approach of
Weibull analysis discussed in Chapter 4, Weibull Modulus, provides
a means of estimating the strength of the objects made of the same
material but different in specimen volume from those tested.
If two groups of specimens made of the same material differ
in size, then eq. 1 can be used to convert from the mean strength
(σ1) of a group of specimens having one volume (V1), to the mean
strength (σ2) that would be expected from the specimens of the
same material prepared in the same way but having a different
specimen volume (V2):

means and standard deviations of strength. B, Lognormal distribution probability plot (or Weibull graph)
showing the strength distributions for the same three products. A product with a higher mean strength will
have a line farther to right on the Weibull graph. A product with a smaller standard deviation will have a line
with a steeper slope on the Weibull graph. If the probability axis is plotted in interval scale and strength axis
is plotted in ordinary scale, each curve will be shaped like the bacterial growth curve shown in the Weibull
analyses of Figure 4-16.

The exponent (m) in eq. 1 is known as the Weibull modulus,
and the determination of this value has been discussed in detail in
Chapter 4, Weibull Modulus. Essentially, the Weibull modulus is
a measure of variability in specimen strengths—similar in purpose
to the standard deviation except having larger values for specimen
groups with less variability. Figure 18-6 shows a comparison of a
typical bar chart showing means and standard deviations of strength
data for three hypothetical materials and the corresponding Weibull
plots comparing the same set of data. The Weibull plot with the
lowest slope (gold) corresponds to the lowest Weibull modulus and
belongs to the group that has the highest standard deviation. The
Weibull plot that lies farthest to the right (blue) corresponds to the
group with the highest average strength. Lifetime data of restorations can also be characterized using a Weibull distribution.
The use of the conversions described previously requires that
the stress distribution be uniform across all portions of a specimen, as in the pure tensile test mode. If the stress distribution
within the object of interest is not uniform, such as in the bending test mode, the effective volume of the specimen is calculated
and used instead of the actual volume. The effective volume is
the volume of a hypothetical tensile test specimen that exhibits
uniform stress distribution when subjected to loading, and that
has the same probability of fracture as the test specimen exhibiting nonuniform stress distribution when loaded. The effective volume is dependent on the loading method and can be determined
by a calculus operation with respect to the volume of the specimen or the prosthesis. The results have already been published for
the common types of test specimens and loading conditions; for
example, the formulas for a cylindrical rod, a rectangular beam,
and a square beam loaded in flexure were published in 2003.

The graph in Figure 18-7 illustrates the conversion of specimen
strengths according to eq. 1 for several different values of Weibull
moduli. In addition to converting between the results of different
test methods, eq. 1 or Figure 18-7 can be used to estimate the
strength of clinically placed prostheses from strength data gathered in vitro.

CRITICAL QUESTION
When should a statistically significant difference between products be
disregarded?

Clinical Significance Versus Statistical
Significance
When interpreting the results of in vitro tests and using them
as a basis for clinical decision making, it is important to keep in
mind the difference between clinical significance and statistical
significance. Statistical significance is achieved when the difference between two dental products is greater than the difference
that is likely caused by random sampling error. For example, suppose 20 denture teeth of the same manufacturer and model are
tested, and this group of specimens has a chipping resistance of
120.0 ± 0.1 N (mean ± standard deviation). Twenty more denture teeth from a different manufacturer are determined using the
same protocol to have a chipping resistance of 121.0 ± 0.2 N. A
statistician would calculate that there is a highly significant difference between these two products (p < 0.001), which indicates
that the 1.0-N difference between our sample means of 120.0 and
121.0 N has a greater than 99.9% chance of being caused by a

• Figure 18-7 Graph illustration of eq. 1. The graph shows the effect of
in vitro test specimen size on the ratio of in vitro product strength to the

material. Specimens, prostheses, and implants having larger volumes of
material are weaker (assuming uniform stress distribution). Products having a high Weibull modulus (m) are less sensitive to differences in the volume of material.

difference between the manufacturers and a less than 0.1% probability of being caused by random chance during specimen selection. In this example, the ability to detect such a small difference
as being highly significant is made possible by the low standard
errors of both groups. This happens during in vitro research when
a very precise test method is used. The ability to detect statistical
significance with a small difference between groups also happens
during clinical research reports when a meta-analysis includes a
large number of studies and therefore patients. The conclusion
that the manufacturers have products of differing quality is scientifically sound. However, changing clinical decisions based on this
small difference would not make sense. The ability of a removable denture to resist chipping from a bite force of 121.0 versus
120.0 N is clinically insignificant because this difference would
not be expected to affect the benefit that the patients receive from
one product versus the other product, especially considering that
chipping resistance is only one of many performance criteria for
removable dentures (esthetics, fit, chemical stability, etc.). A difference is clinically significant when this difference would make a
noticeable impact on the average patient, and smaller differences
should not influence clinical decisions even when they are shown
to be statistically significant.

Standardization of In Vitro Test Methods
One of the major advances in the knowledge of dental materials and their manipulation began in 1919, when the U.S. Army
requested the National Bureau of Standards (now known as the
National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST) to
establish specifications for the evaluation and selection of dental amalgams for use in federal service. These test reports were
received enthusiastically by the dental profession, and similar test
reports were subsequently requested for other dental materials.
All findings were published and became common property under
this arrangement. In 1928, dental research at the National Bureau
of Standards was taken over by the American Dental Association
(ADA). In this section, we will describe the role of the ADA and
international organizations in establishing standards.

In Vitro Research on Dental Materials

ADA Specifications and Acceptance Program
The ADA, accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), is also the administrative sponsor of two standards-formulating committees operating under the direction of
the ANSI: the ADA Standards Committee on Dental Products
(SCDP) and the ADA Standards Committee on Dental Informatics (SCDI). The ADA SCDP develops specifications for all dental materials and instruments, with the exceptions of drugs and
x-ray films. The ADA Council on Scientific Affairs (CSA) is also
separately responsible for the evaluation of drugs, tooth-cleaning
and tooth-whitening agents, therapeutic agents used in dentistry,
dental equipment, and dental x-ray film.
Working groups of the ADA SCDP or ADA CSA develop the
specifications. When a specification has been approved by the
ADA SCDP and the ADA CSA, this specification is submitted to
the ANSI. On acceptance by this body, the specification becomes
a U.S. national standard. New specifications are continually being
developed to apply to new products. Likewise, existing specifications are periodically revised to reflect changes in product formulations and new knowledge about the behavior of materials in the
oral cavity.
In 1930, the ADA Council on Dental Therapeutics established
the ADA’s Seal of Acceptance program to promote the safety and
effectiveness of dental products. When the ADA CSA assumed
responsibility for developing specifications (standard test methods) in 1966, the CSA also initiated the certification of products
that meet the requirements of these specifications. The Seal of
Acceptance program incorporates these specifications in the evaluation of dental products. When a product is classified as accepted,
the manufacturer is permitted to signify on the label of the product that notation “ADA Accepted.”
In 2005, the ADA decided to phase out the professional products component of the Seal of Acceptance program. Instead, a
decision was made to publish a product evaluation newsletter for
ADA member dentists that focused on a specific category of professional products in each article. This newsletter, called the Professional Product Review, was initiated in July 2006, and the final
phase-out of the ADA acceptance seal for professional products
occurred on December 31, 2007. Keep in mind that the acceptance program for oral care products sold to the general public,
including toothpaste, dental floss, toothbrushes, mouth rinse, and
so forth, is still in place.

International Standards
Two organizations, the Fédération Dentaire Internationale (FDI)
and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO),
are working toward the establishment of specifications for dental
materials on an international level. The ISO is an international,
nongovernmental organization whose objective is the development of international standards. This body is composed of
national standards organizations from more than 80 countries.
ANSI is the U.S. member of the ISO. As of 2018, the ISO had
249 technical committees (TCs). Originally, the FDI initiated and
actively supported a program for the development of international
specifications for dental materials. A request by the FDI to the
ISO that it should consider FDI specifications for dental materials
as ISO standards led to the formation of the technical committee
ISO TC 106—Dentistry. The responsibility of this committee is
to standardize terminology and test methods and to develop international standards for dental materials, instruments, appliances,

and equipment. More than 180 dental standards have been published by TC 106, and 55 dental standards are currently under
development. The following four subcommittees cover most of
the dental restorative materials products included in the ISO standards program under the direction of TC 106:
TC106/SC1: Filling and Restorative Materials. The following 10
working groups (WGs) are included: WG1—Zinc Oxide/
Eugenol Cements and Noneugenol Cements; WG2—
Endodontic Materials; WG5—Pit and Fissure Sealants;
WG7—Dental Amalgam; WG9—Polymer-Based Restorative Materials; WG10—Dental Luting Cements, Bases,
and Liners; WG11—Adhesion Test Methods; WG13—
Orthodontic Products; WG14—Orthodontic Elastics; and
WG15— Adhesive Components.
TC106/SC2: Prosthodontic Materials. The following 18 working groups develop standards for prosthodontic materials: WG1—Dental Ceramics; WG2—Dental Base Alloys;
WG6—Color Stability Test Methods; WG7—Impression
Materials; WG8—Noble-Metal Casting Alloys; WG10—
Resilient Lining Materials: WG11—Denture Base Polymers;
WG12—Corrosion Test Methods; WG13—Investments;
WG14—Dental Brazing Materials; WG16—Polymer
Veneering and Die Materials; WG18—Dental Waxes and
Baseplate Waxes; WG19—Wear Test Methods; WG20—
Artificial Teeth; WG21—Metallic Materials; WG22—
Magnetic Attachments; WG23—Chairside Denture Base
Relining Materials; and WG24—Frictional Retention.
TC106/SC8: Dental Implants. The eight groups in SC8 are as
follows: TG2—Dental Implant Terminology; WG1—
Implantable Materials; WG2—Preclinical Biological Evaluation and Testing; WG3—Content of Technical Files;
WG4—Mechanical Testing; WG5—Dentistry – Implant
Terminology; WG6—Preclinical Performance Requirements;
and WG7—Evaluation of Connective Interfaces of Dental
Implant Systems.
TC106/SC9: Dental CAD/CAM Systems. The five working
groups in SC9 are as follows: WG3—Digitizing Devices;
WG4—Interoperability;
WG5—Machined
Devices;
WG6—Machinable Blanks; and WG7—Test Methods for
Additive Manufactured Dental Products.
When the term dental materials is used, dental restorative materials are often foremost in mind, but it should be clear from the
list of working groups that there are many auxiliary materials and
many preventative materials that also require testing. For some of
those materials, in vitro tests are needed to gauge a wide variety
of material properties, including mechanical, chemical, magnetic,
and optical properties, among others. The working groups are
continuing to change year to year as new categories of materials
are being introduced, and some categories of materials are becoming obsolete.

CRITICAL QUESTION
Why would a specification require using a test that is not the most precise
test method?

Limitations of Standards for In Vitro Research
It is also important to know the functions that standards and specifications are not meant to perform. The minimum performance
limits specified in standards are not representative of the performance of the average product currently on the market. They are

instead minimum acceptable thresholds for safety and satisfactory
performance. In addition, the test methods described in standards
and specifications are not necessarily the best or the most precise methods. Standard tests are limited in that they generally use
inexpensive equipment and supplies that are readily available in
most laboratories, and they generally do not require complex statistical tests. In addition, a standard is not adopted unless this standard
can be agreed upon by many experts having a wide variety of perspectives. This means that standards are only the greatest common
factor between the different methods that are used successfully in
multiple laboratories. In addition, there are some important material
properties for which there is no standard test. This could be caused
by a lack of agreement among experts, by a lack of timeliness in
the approval process, or by the invention of a novel dental product
that cannot be adequately tested using any currently known tests.
For example, fracture toughness is an important metric for comparing ceramics to be used in fixed dental prostheses because fracture
toughness is independent of surface finish, testing environment,
and loading method. The ISO standard for dental ceramics (ISO
6872:2015) does not identify or require a single test for fracturetoughness testing. Instead, the standard contains an informational
appendix that discusses the advantages and disadvantages of several
fracture-toughness test methods. A fracture-toughness test typically
begins with scoring or precracking the test specimen, and the tip of
this precrack should be smaller than the crystalline grains that constitute the material microstructure. Otherwise, overestimation of the
fracture toughness will result. However, the newest and most durable
ceramic materials have submicron grain sizes, and some of the most
popular test methods cannot create a precrack that is sharp enough
to accurately assess the fracture toughness of those materials.
Standards perform an important function in communication
between researchers and in government regulation of products,
as described previously, but the scientific literature often contains
results from different in vitro tests that are more precise or that
more closely mimic clinical conditions. The editorial board of the
journal Dental Materials has begun assigning teams of experts to
coauthor guidance documents for testing material properties that
have proven challenging in the past. These guidance documents
describe the test methods that currently have the maximum possible accuracy or precision in lieu of standards that use easily obtainable equipment. In some cases where a standard allows a range of
test parameters, the guidance document explains why one specific
parameter setting is preferable over another. For example, the ISO
standard for fatigue testing of dental implants (ISO 14801:2016)
allows the holder, which simulates bone holding the implants, to
have any mechanical properties so long as the Young’s modulus
(stiffness) of the specimen holder is higher than 3 GPa. This is conveniently close to the Young’s modulus of many epoxy and acrylic
products that are already present in most material sciences laboratories. Unfortunately, this value is much lower than the stiffness
of a typical jawbone and does not mimic the difference in stiffness
between the cortical and cancellous layers or the anisotropy within
a given layer. Computer models show that this difference in stiffness of the holder material has a strong effect on the results of the
mean lifetime prediction of implant systems, so holder materials
that more closely mimic real bone would be preferable. In some
cases, the most advanced test methods are not feasible for use in
many laboratories, and simple standard tests must be used. For
example, tests that employ cyclic fatigue loading more accurately
mimic the clinical situation, and the use of sliding contact during
the load cycle has been shown to give a different test result than
loading methods that are less clinically relevant. Equipment that

is capable of precisely controlling the cyclic loading of specimens
on both horizontal and vertical axes simultaneously can be expensive to acquire and maintain, so ISO 6872:2015 specifies the use
of only monotonic (noncyclic) vertical loading, and this remains
an important common factor for comparing results regarding the
strength of ceramics used in fixed dental prostheses.
