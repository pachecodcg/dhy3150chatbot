## ⚡ 3-STEP UPLOAD PROCESS

### STEP 1: Upload Backend (4 files)
In GitHub, create these files:
1. `backend/app.py` (paste from package)
2. `backend/requirements.txt` (paste from package)
3. `backend/instructions.txt` (paste from package)
4. Delete `backend/knowledge_base/README-DELETE-ME.txt`

### STEP 2: Upload Your Materials
In `backend/knowledge_base/`, add:
1. Your syllabus (.txt file)
2. Your lecture notes (.txt or .md files)
3. Phillips chapters (if you have them - 20 files)

### STEP 3: Upload Frontend
1. Create `docs/index.html` (paste from package)
2. Verify API_URL matches your Vercel URL

## 🎯 Vercel Settings

**When deploying:**
- Root Directory: `backend` ← CRITICAL!
- Environment Variable: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = your-key-here

---

## 📱 GitHub Pages Settings

**In repo Settings → Pages:**
- Source: Deploy from branch
- Branch: `main`
- Folder: `/docs` ← CRITICAL!

---

## ✅ Final URLs

**Your students use:**
`https://yourusername.github.io/reponame/`

**Backend runs at:**
`https://yourproject.vercel.app`

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

❌ Root directory not set to `backend` in Vercel
❌ GitHub Pages folder not set to `/docs`
❌ API_URL in index.html doesn't match Vercel URL
❌ Forgot to add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
❌ Uploaded files but didn't commit them

✅ Follow the checklist in README.txt!

---

## 💡 File Size Limits

To avoid rate limits:
- Syllabus: < 50 KB
- Each lecture: < 100 KB  
- Phillips chapters: 50-175 KB each (already optimized)
- Don't upload one giant 2 MB file!

---

## 📞 If Students Get Errors

1. Check status indicator (green = working)
2. Verify Vercel backend is deployed
3. Check API key has credits
4. Look at Vercel deployment logs

That's it! Follow README.txt for detailed instructions.
